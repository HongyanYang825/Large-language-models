One of CDOs’ key statutory responsibilities is ensuring agencies maximize the use of data to produce evidence and improve agency operations. The Federal Chief Data Officers Council’s Playbook highlighted the opportunities and risks facing CDOs in government. The role of a federal CDO is increasingly crucial for enhancing an agency's data capabilities and delivering value to the organization and society. To fully realize their potential and avoid becoming a mere compliance function, CDOs first focused on finding opportunities to promote the sharing and access of data within their agencies. They worked to build critical relationships and to show value in the near term through “quick wins,” building data governance and master data management programs, which take longer to implement and demonstrate results, in parallel with key value delivery projects. In the next phase of agency data strategy implementations, federal CDOs are already working to make enterprise analytics a strategic focus of their agenda."

In the next phase of agency data strategy implementations, federal CDOs are already working to make enterprise analytics a strategic focus of their agenda. In fact, nearly 50% of respondents to the annual Federal CDO Council Survey indicated they were the primary accountable official or had managerial responsibility for their agency enterprise analytics program. By embracing enterprise analytics, CDOs are leading the transition from being data managers to strategic enterprise value generators. Adopting an enterprise analytics program is a natural and necessary progression for CDOs who want to maximize their value to their agencies. Enterprise analytics programs allow CDOs to help their agencies leverage data as a strategic asset comprehensively, fulfilling both their roles as change agents and leaders. Enterprise analytics programs go beyond basic data collection and organization, serving as a comprehensive approach to deriving actionable insights that inform strategic decisions. These programs are supported by a set of cohesive and integrated strategies designed to enable agencies to holistically leverage data as a strategic asset to drive organizational health, performance, and mission outcomes. Additionally, these programs typically include enterprise tools for common mission support functions (e.g., human resources [HR], information technology"
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,3,"Additionally, these programs typically include enterprise tools for common mission support functions (e.g., human resources [HR], information technology [IT], and finance) and integrate mission data across programs to answer key priority questions. Enterprise analytics programs can be implemented to solve several common strategic barriers to leveraging data to produce evidence at agencies across government. The barriers include: ● Lack of access to comprehensive, up-to-date, or actionable operational data in common functions like HR, IT, and finance. ● Lack of an enterprise view into agency data assets to answer common questions and duplication of effort across component areas and programs. ● Duplication of analytics infrastructure and tools, resulting in cost-inefficiencies and fragmented approaches to analytics. ● Cultural or technical challenges at agencies sharing insights outside of functional practitioner circles to inform enterprise and program decision-making. 4 Enterprise Analytics programs include all the following key components: ● Align with the agency strategy and performance plan. ● Invest in workforce capabilities that enable use of data as a strategic asset."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,4,"4 Enterprise Analytics programs include all the following key components: ● Align with the agency strategy and performance plan. ● Invest in workforce capabilities that enable use of data as a strategic asset. ● Leverage technologies to analyze and visualize data. ● Centralize and curate data and data products for access and use across the entire agency. This paper seeks to help agency CDOs implement these key components by applying lessons from agencies that have successfully implemented enterprise analytics programs since the passage of the Evidence Act. A companion paper, “The Data-Driven CDO,” addresses related challenges as well as several ways CDOs can measure the impact and value of their initiatives, including enterprise analytics programs, and proposes adopting a product management mentality in addition to an asset management mentality to help ensure alignment of data programs and initiatives to business and mission outcomes. 5 Historical and Current Challenges in Federal Enterprise Analytics Harnessing the potential of data to produce evidence has been a key goal for agencies, but several key barriers exist that agencies must solve systematically. Historically, a major issue has been siloed data systems. In most agencies, data was collected, managed, and analyzed in disparate systems across various bureaus and divisions closest to the programs that needed it. This made it difficult to aggregate, analyze, and leverage the agency’s holistic data assets."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,5,"In most agencies, data was collected, managed, and analyzed in disparate systems across various bureaus and divisions closest to the programs that needed it. This made it difficult to aggregate, analyze, and leverage the agency’s holistic data assets. This distributed approach also leads agencies to purchase or ingest key external data sources from other agencies or entities in highly duplicative and cost inefficient ways. Disconnected data also resulted in long response times to data inquiries and inhibited the ability to use data for strategic decision-making at an enterprise level while creating duplication in creating analytics tools to answer common questions. Overall, the lack of an enterprise approach to enterprise analytics has resulted in these common tendencies: ● Agencies generate and maintain data across large numbers of applications and data stores that could be made available to analysts and leadership to inform policy. However, today much of this data is not cataloged and is difficult for non-specialists to find and access. ● Where data is accessible, it is disconnected from other relevant data that would provide deeper insights if analyzed in tandem. ● Analytics products are also built multiple times—component agency by component agency or program by program—rather than answering cross-cutting questions. ● Reports and data calls are routinely generated manually across programs, resulting in redundant, low-value work across agencies. As a result, decisions are frequently made with outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete information."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,5,"● Reports and data calls are routinely generated manually across programs, resulting in redundant, low-value work across agencies. As a result, decisions are frequently made with outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete information. ● Within agencies, there is significant duplication of costs due to the use of many different data warehousing technologies and analytics tools. ● Furthermore, the use of many different data analytics tools creates a costly and fragmented user experience for agency decision makers who need holistic management insights. Even when agencies have managed to overcome these challenges and successfully implement sophisticated data analytics systems, they often face another significant hurdle: creating a culture that values and effectively uses the insights these systems provide. In many cases, having a mindset that is reluctant to change entrenched ways of working can act as a barrier to the adoption of a data-driven decision-making approach. Without buy-in at all levels of the organization, the full potential of these analytics systems cannot be realized. 6 Implementation of Enterprise-wide Analytics & Data Dashboards Agency Case Studies The application of enterprise analytics is changing how federal agencies who have implemented these principles will operate, enabling them to make better-informed decisions, improve service delivery, and optimize resources. This section discusses the successful implementation of these initiatives in two significant federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of State. The USDA, a sprawling agency with a vast array of responsibilities, faced significant data management challenges due to fragmented data sources."

The USDA, a sprawling agency with a vast array of responsibilities, faced significant data management challenges due to fragmented data sources. Simple inquiries often took weeks due to data being sequestered in unconnected silos. To address this issue, USDA adopted an enterprise analytics approach. A CDO was appointed and the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Tools (EDAPT) were developed, providing a unified platform for over 150 internal and external data sources. The transformative power of EDAPT was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was leveraged to quickly develop a dashboard providing crucial data for managing the agency's expansive workforce. This initiative, alongside a comprehensive strategy fostering a data-driven culture and collaboration, exemplifies the successful implementation of enterprise analytics. Similarly, the Department of State, with its extensive global operations, faced challenges in accessing and analyzing data in a timely, centralized manner. In response, the Department made Data-Informed Diplomacy an Agency Priority Goal (APG) and appointed a CDO to oversee its implementation. As part of their enterprise analytics initiative, the Department of State devised an Enterprise Data Strategy (EDS), backed by an Enterprise Data Council (EDC)."

As part of their enterprise analytics initiative, the Department of State devised an Enterprise Data Strategy (EDS), backed by an Enterprise Data Council (EDC). The strategy included hiring data scientists, implementing comprehensive data literacy training, and launching focused data campaigns addressing critical areas such as cybersecurity and climate change. Moreover, the Department of State established a common data infrastructure facilitating data sharing and providing data management services. This cross-functional collaboration between the CDO and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) led to effective technological solutions for data creation, storage, protection, and sharing. Department-wide data training events reached over 6,500 employees, and the development of new analytical tools provided valuable insights into complex, enterprise-wide challenges. These case studies from USDA and the Department of State exemplify the transformative power of enterprise analytics in federal agencies. By leveraging centralized data systems, fostering a data-driven culture, and emphasizing collaboration and data literacy, agencies can drive their operations towards increased efficiency, informed decision-making, and improved service delivery. 7 Government-wide Case Studies: Pandemic Response and Workforce Dashboards When the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact the United States in January 2020, the Chief Data Officer Council met for the first time. By April, the significant threats to the nation posed by the pandemic were clear, and agency demands for data and decision support tools were at an all-time high."

By April, the significant threats to the nation posed by the pandemic were clear, and agency demands for data and decision support tools were at an all-time high. In response, the CDO Council quickly established its very first working group focused on COVID-19 data. The working group set out to identify the key questions agencies had as well as the data and tools needed to support agency response efforts. The working group found that data existed to answer federal agencies’ questions about public health, workforce safety, and continuity of operations. However, the working group also found that Federal leaders and staff on the ground experienced significant challenges accessing that data, inhibiting their efforts to build dashboards and other tools needed for analysis and decision-making. To support this need, the working group collaborated across agency lines to ensure public health data held by the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services was more readily available for federal agency use. The working group created and shared domestic and international COVID-19 analytics dashboards across federal agencies while developing guidance that supported consistent use of the data. The working group also captured valuable lessons learned and identified gaps that informed its future thinking about how best to enable decision support on common or urgent issues across multiple federal agencies. Through this effort, the CDO Council recognized an opportunity to analyze how sharing decision-support tools across agencies could offer significant value."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,7,"The working group also captured valuable lessons learned and identified gaps that informed its future thinking about how best to enable decision support on common or urgent issues across multiple federal agencies. Through this effort, the CDO Council recognized an opportunity to analyze how sharing decision-support tools across agencies could offer significant value. While government agencies were increasingly relying on data to drive effective decision-making, they were still frequently developing these solutions in parallel, duplicating efforts and solving the same problems that other agencies had already solved. Furthermore, standing up these decision-support tools can be costly and time-consuming, and crises and priorities such as COVID-19 workforce safety and equity demonstrated the urgent need to ensure leadership across the government has access to critical, trusted information to make decisions on urgent and evolving situations with the best available data. To continue its efforts to solve the challenges associated with sharing decision support across government to provide answers to common questions, the CDO Council developed a proof of concept dashboard and recommendations report to demonstrate how multiple agencies could visualize their HR data in a standardized dashboard and inform best practices for advancing federal data analytics. The CDO Council worked with stakeholder agencies across the government to develop a proof of concept Human Resources (HR) dashboard, more specifically, a Diversity Profile aligned with the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The proof of concept demonstrated how agencies government-wide can benefit from efficiencies in generalizable, best-in-class dashboards that can be shared and reused across the federal government to help individual agencies respond more quickly and effectively to emergent issues and ever-changing current events. 8 Figure 1. Diversity Profile Dashboard. Federal HR Dashboarding Report (2021)."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,8,"Diversity Profile Dashboard. Federal HR Dashboarding Report (2021). The CDO Council also recommended the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offer government-wide dashboards via authenticated login for agencies to access data visualizations populated with their data. The CDO Council report concluded the dashboards would add value by leveraging data and save significantly on the cost and time required to stand-up the technical infrastructure to support individual agency data visualization efforts across government. In April 2023, OPM released its first enterprise data analytics strategy for FY23-26, which outlines its goals for OPM to deliver high-quality human data products that inform and support critical decision-making for OPM, federal agencies, employees, and the public. Given that OPM collects data on the federal civilian workforce across the employee lifecycle, from recruiting to employment to retirement, the agency has a historic opportunity to become a hub for delivering data-driven policy, enhanced analytics, data standards and digital solutions that together are key enablers for strategic human capital management across the federal government. OPM and federal agencies can harness the power of data for advanced analytics and personalized digital-first tools while ensuring the data is accessed securely and with privacy-protecting measures in place. OPM can increase interoperability between agencies by implementing common data standards and templates all federal departments can adopt. And OPM can better leverage existing data to power a personalized customer experience that better serves our customers. In line with the CDO Council’s recommendations, OPM released a suite of authenticated government-wide HR dashboards in September 2023 that include tools providing insights and key metrics related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA), the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, attrition, and time-to-hire."

Through the consolidation, analysis, and leverage of data from diverse sources, agencies can make better-informed decisions, streamline operations, and enhance public service delivery. Elevating data-informed decision-making to a high-level organizational priority is a key component of building an agency’s evidence-building culture. This commitment emphasizes the strategic value of data in guiding policy and operational decisions. The CDO has a prime opportunity to align data strategy with organizational goals, moving beyond compliance to become a value generator for the agency. This alignment makes the development and implementation of enterprise analytics programs essential. To effectively align an enterprise analytics program with an agency strategy, CDOs should work with other Evidence Act officials to determine which data should be managed at the enterprise level."

CDOs must facilitate choices about which data to centrally manage and curate and which to keep closely aligned with agency components and programs. Focusing on the data that are most important to the questions posed in the agency’s strategic planning documents, such as the strategic plan, performance plan, learning agenda, evaluation plan, and customer experience plans, is a necessary step. CDOs are already taking the lead. Table 1. To what extent does your role as CDO involve oversight of enterprise analytics for your agency?

As seen above, nearly 8 in 9 CDOs who responded to the Federal CDO Council Survey have some responsibility for overseeing their agency enterprise analytics programs. Investing in Workforce Capabilities That Enable Usage of Data as a Strategic Asset Encouraging a collaborative, cross-functional approach to data management ensures diverse perspectives as agencies implement their enterprise analytics programs. By serving various stakeholders, enterprise analytics programs can benefit from unique insights and enhance their effectiveness. In addition, the synergy between the CDO and CIO is crucial for the success of any enterprise analytics program. Agencies should aim to strengthen this relationship, irrespective of their current reporting structures. The cultivation of a data-driven culture within an agency is crucial.

Indeed, data skills assessments were one of the first actions in the Federal Data Strategy Action Plans. Since the issuance of the strategy, the CDO Council has developed additional resources for data skills programs. CDOs can rely on the following resources to help build their workforce development programs: the Improving Agency Data Skills Playbook, the Data Skills Training Program Implementation Toolkit, and the Data Skills Training Program Case Studies. 12 Leveraging Technologies to Analyze and Visualize Data The relationship between the CDO and CIO is also critical to the success of enterprise analytics programs.

Given there are many common needs of data management and analytics across agencies, infrastructure, tools, and data procurement decisions should aim for the most efficiency possible. Centralizing and Curating Data and Data Products for Access and use Across the Entire Agency CDOs are responsible for establishing robust agency data governance structures that ensure alignment of data management practices with agency goals. These structures promote consistency and standardization in data usage, maximizing the strategic utility of data. The creation of clear data governance structures, such as the establishment of a CDO and the Enterprise Data Council at the Department of State, played a key role in steering the enterprise analytics initiatives. These structures provided leadership, drove strategy, and ensured accountability for the data transformation process.

Enterprise analytics programs rely heavily on technology that enables cataloging, integration, and sharing of agency data to enhance decision-making, while also preserving privacy and security. Effective management and use of such technologies require close alignment with agency data governance. Structuring an enterprise analytics program with accountability to a data governance board may vary based on the data focus (mission or mission support) as well as the outputs (dashboards and other data products).

Based on the case studies of USDA and the Department of State, the success factors in the implementation of enterprise analytics across CFO Act agencies are multifold. They illustrate not only the significant role of robust analytics platforms but also the critical importance of fostering a data-driven culture, the value of collaboration, and the necessity of robust governance and management structures. Current Landscape Federal agencies are at various stages in their data journey, as indicated by the 2022 and 2023 CDO Council annual survey. Some CDOs have robust data science teams and are making strides in analytics and artificial intelligence.

Models for increased resources have included increases in appropriations for CDO organizations and enterprise-shared service models. Other CDOs are working as a team of one or are wearing multiple hats. The 2023 survey also revealed an interesting paradox: despite a general lack of mature platforms and data integration, agencies are reporting higher levels of mature analytics and dashboards. Key Survey Findings ● Oversight of Enterprise Analytics: Most CDOs in CFO Act agencies share or manage the responsibility for enterprise analytics. However, in non-CFO Act agencies, the CDO is more often the primary accountable official. ● Platform Maturity: Both types of agencies are lagging in platform maturity compared to their reported data integration and analytics and dashboard maturity. ● Mission-Support Data Integration: CFO Act agencies show a focus on pilot and experimental stages of mission-support data integration, with no significant maturity reported. ● Mission-Specific Data Integration: Non-CFO Act agencies reported higher maturity levels in mission-specific data integration compared to mission-support data."

Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,18,"17 The Role of the Chief Data Officer in Implementing Enterprise Analytics The role of the federal CDO is pivotal and transformational, particularly in the management and strategic use of data. The position has the potential to significantly enhance data collection, organization, and analysis, thereby providing immense value to both federal agencies and society at large. As agents of change, CDOs must articulate an inspiring vision of data's transformative capabilities for stakeholders. Based on the case studies of USDA and the Department of State, the success factors in the implementation of enterprise analytics across CFO Act agencies are multifold. They illustrate not only the significant role of robust analytics platforms but also the critical importance of fostering a data-driven culture, the value of collaboration, and the necessity of robust governance and management structures. Current Landscape Federal agencies are at various stages in their data journey, as indicated by the 2022 and 2023 CDO Council annual survey. Some CDOs have robust data science teams and are making strides in analytics and artificial intelligence. The data suggest that Federal CDOs who deliver valuable enterprise analytics programs are able to secure the necessary resources to fund their activities. Three years later, some CDOs have already built large enterprise teams and are significantly advancing evidence-building capabilities at their agencies."

Three years later, some CDOs have already built large enterprise teams and are significantly advancing evidence-building capabilities at their agencies. Models for increased resources have included increases in appropriations for CDO organizations and enterprise-shared service models. Other CDOs are working as a team of one or are wearing multiple hats. The 2023 survey also revealed an interesting paradox: despite a general lack of mature platforms and data integration, agencies are reporting higher levels of mature analytics and dashboards. Key Survey Findings ● Oversight of Enterprise Analytics: Most CDOs in CFO Act agencies share or manage the responsibility for enterprise analytics. However, in non-CFO Act agencies, the CDO is more often the primary accountable official. ● Platform Maturity: Both types of agencies are lagging in platform maturity compared to their reported data integration and analytics and dashboard maturity. ● Mission-Support Data Integration: CFO Act agencies show a focus on pilot and experimental stages of mission-support data integration, with no significant maturity reported. ● Mission-Specific Data Integration: Non-CFO Act agencies reported higher maturity levels in mission-specific data integration compared to mission-support data."

The Challenge The Department lacked the ability to access data readily to solve enterprise-level challenges in a timely manner. It also did not have a central platform to both access and analyze this data. Pockets of analytics excellence existed throughout the Department, but there was no central body to guide the use of analytics tools and provide training and support across the enterprise. The Solution The Department convened a working group of subject matter experts to determine the criteria for success and responsibilities of the CDO in the department. It was decided that the CDO would be responsible for enterprise data management, data culture-building, enterprise analytics, and, in partnership with the department’s CIO, data infrastructure. Key to Success: The Enterprise Data Strategy ● State Department Enterprise Data Strategy: The CDO executes the 14 OPEN Government Data Act requirements through implementation of the department’s first- ever Enterprise Data Strategy (EDS).

The most critical dimension of creating data-informed diplomacy is to build a culture of data. The Department has continued to create opportunities to make data assets more accessible across the agency, to support efforts to increase data literacy at all levels within the existing workforce and to recruit high-end data talent through multiple hiring mechanisms. Examples include: ● Data Training Courses at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI): Adding a suite of data science and data literacy training courses offered by the FSI, the Department has also incorporated data training into three Foreign Service Officer tradecraft courses and the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission training courses. ● Baseline Data Literacy Course Online: The State Department's Center for Analytics (M/SS/CfA) piloted an online self-study tool and created a custom baseline data literacy track for employees to complete.

Leveraging the State Department’s vast datasets as a strategic asset is critical to achieving ambitious administration goals in addressing climate change, increasing nutrition security, ensuring thriving rural communities and economies, increasing opportunity for agricultural products at home and abroad, and advancing equity across federal programs and services. Over the past three years, the USDA has established the CDO role with the responsibilities required under the Evidence Act and created the Assistant CDO position in each USDA Mission Area. These leaders are supported by centralized analytics teams to perform and advance the use of analytics. The Department has also developed enterprise-wide data dashboards to improve decision-making while reducing manual data collection and has launched the Enterprise Data 25 Analytics Platform and Toolset (EDAPT). This platform provides a standardized, centrally available set of tools and connected data sources to enable a broad range of analytics from descriptive methods to advanced predictive techniques and natural language processing. EDAPT eliminates technology as a barrier to data sharing and analytics within and across agencies and integrates data analysis for more than 150 sources from every corner of USDA as well as outside the Department. These initial investments have enabled partnerships across Department, Mission Area, Program Area, Statistical Official, CDO, and Evaluation Officer functions that substantially advance the department’s evidence-building capacity both internally and externally. Challenge In 2017, data-driven decision-making and evidence-building was difficult across the sprawling USDA with its 29 agencies and staff offices and nearly 100,000 employees relying on data trapped in hundreds of unconnected siloes throughout the organization."

Challenge In 2017, data-driven decision-making and evidence-building was difficult across the sprawling USDA with its 29 agencies and staff offices and nearly 100,000 employees relying on data trapped in hundreds of unconnected siloes throughout the organization. When a leader at USDA asked a simple logistical question—like “How many vehicles does the agency have, and how many are underutilized?”—the answer might take weeks, requiring manual data calls across multiple agencies and offices. This challenge extended to nearly every part of the department’s administration, including HR, finance, operations, and more. The situation was no different for programs delivering support to citizens, such as farm loans and disaster assistance. Gaining fast, data-driven insights for actual mission delivery was nearly difficult or impossible. This was problematic because making better decisions ultimately relies on the ability to assemble many types of data from many disparate sources and then transform it into something actionable. Yet the substantial challenge presented an even greater opportunity. Changing how USDA harnesses and leverages its data could enable the department to look forward and anticipate—or very rapidly respond to—emerging issues facing the country. And if a crisis hit, USDA would be much better positioned to navigate it if leadership had access to integrated, transparent information intended to visualize and answer the most pressing questions as they arose."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,25,"Changing how USDA harnesses and leverages its data could enable the department to look forward and anticipate—or very rapidly respond to—emerging issues facing the country. And if a crisis hit, USDA would be much better positioned to navigate it if leadership had access to integrated, transparent information intended to visualize and answer the most pressing questions as they arose. To confront the challenge, the CDO within USDA worked closely with departmental partners to overhaul and rethink how the department used its massive amounts of data in new and innovative ways. Starting in November 2017, the team interviewed administrative leaders to understand the most pressing questions for USDA leadership. Rather than traditional requirements documents, these conversations leveraged design thinking strategies and engagement sessions. Once those pressing questions were identified, the team began three-month “sprints” for each administrative function to understand what data was needed to improve operations, what data existed, and how reliable it was. Turning that data into automated, real-time insights for USDA leaders required building extensive new infrastructure, standing up what would become USDA’s Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset (EDAPT). In just one year, the team delivered over 120 distinct dashboards that illuminate critical data across the Department. With a solid foundation that aided leadership’s decision-making across the department, USDA shifted its focus in the second year of the project to providing the same kinds of solutions for some of the agency’s specific citizen-facing programs. The team worked with each of USDA’s eight “Mission Areas,” each with diverse programs and needs, to develop a foundational set of tools that spanned nearly every facet from employee attrition to fighting forest fires to understanding the impact of research."

The team worked with each of USDA’s eight “Mission Areas,” each with diverse programs and needs, to develop a foundational set of tools that spanned nearly every facet from employee attrition to fighting forest fires to understanding the impact of research. For example, state conservationists at the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (FPAC) have access to a real-time scorecard with more than a 26 dozen key metrics spanning both program outcomes and operational management to help more efficiently administer government resources in support of conservation. Forest Supervisors in the Forest Service have access to an integrated view of timber sales, fuels treatments, budget, fleet, and HR data for each individual forest to help them better manage our natural and government resources sustainably and efficiently. Scientists & Operational Field leaders across the Office of Food Safety have access to more timely data around the status of laboratory sampling as well as key public health indicators for every food processing establishment OFS regulates. To address these varied needs, the team brought new, advanced capabilities online, like artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and a governance process for cataloging data and standardizing analytics tools that enable collaboration and sharing across the organization. The department also established USDA’s Open Data Platform which enables the department to publish dashboards that provide the public and third-party authenticated users with the ability to draw data-driven insights, as well as download important data about USDA programs. This expanded toolkit enabled USDA to move from descriptive to predictive analysis and to address even bigger challenges. People and Culture While these data and analytics innovations have delivered immense value to USDA, the most long standing benefit may be the growth of USDA’s culture as a data-driven organization that supports evidence-building internally and externally."

People and Culture While these data and analytics innovations have delivered immense value to USDA, the most long standing benefit may be the growth of USDA’s culture as a data-driven organization that supports evidence-building internally and externally. In the early days, internal skepticism was the most substantial obstacle: employees had become accustomed to slow answers to questions requiring data as part of the solution. Over the course of this initiative, the team was able to flip this paradigm on its head, fundamentally raising the bar when it comes to data and analytics. The increased expectations about what was possible at USDA created the organizational vision to address data leadership and skills gaps that would be needed to effectively scale the emerging capabilities. To support this, USDA established entirely new data functions across the organization, establishing the role of the Assistant Chief Data Officer (ACDO) within each Mission Area to lead Mission Area data strategy and governance activities, and provide leadership as follows: ● Establish consistency and governance in managing data across the Mission Area so data can be more easily used and shared within proper security parameters. ● Oversee centralized analytics teams and provide analytics capacity to address cross- cutting questions or issues within the Mission Area. ● Enable program areas to conduct program-specific analytics with common tools. ● Ensure Mission Area alignment with USDA data strategy."
Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,26,"● Enable program areas to conduct program-specific analytics with common tools. ● Ensure Mission Area alignment with USDA data strategy. USDA has developed an organizational model for centralized analytics teams in each of its Mission Areas. These teams, led by the ACDO, support their respective Mission Areas by answering key cross-cutting questions with data and fostering analytics training and development more broadly across the Mission Area by performing the following activities: ● Identify and help solve major cross-cutting strategic questions using data analysis and advanced data analytics techniques and methods, including advances in data science such as machine learning, neural networks, and other forms of artificial intelligence. 27 ● Create analytics products, such as data visualizations, scenario analysis tools, and prescriptive or predictive models, to draw insight from across Mission Area data sets, including structured, semi-structured data, and unstructured (e.g., text), for day-to-day use by business leaders. ● Provide ad hoc analytics services to various parts of the Mission Area. ● Cultivate a data-driven organization through the development and enablement of the workforce. To address the need for greater integration and to foster a more collaborative, data-driven environment, USDA established two communities of practice (CoPs) under leadership of ACDOs, bringing together individuals with an interest or established skill set in data visualization and analytics. Through these CoPs, best practices, and tips—as well as examples of advanced dashboard development and data usage—are shared, encouraging questions and conversations among the groups, effectively raising the collective awareness and knowledge levels of cross-departmental staff. The Data Visualization CoP promotes the greater adoption of data visualization tools to assist all Mission Areas in building a culture that values data and promotes public use."

The CoP unearths and showcases institutional knowledge and experience in relation to analytical approaches to best practices, methodologies and tools and cultivates a data-driven organization through the development and enablement of the workforce. Sharing best practices, challenges, and successes is proven to be an effective way to improve data management and analytics throughout the department by fostering an openly collaborative learning environment. With employee buy-in, a new, data-driven decision culture has taken root at USDA, removing manually burdensome processes and enabling employees to focus on their mission of delivering vital programs that support America’s people, farmers, ranchers, and producers. With all these key technical and workforce capabilities in place, USDA was better able to respond when the need for data was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Enterprise-Analytics-Report-508-FINAL.pdf,27,"The department worked with the Federal Chief Data Officer Council to identify common agency data needs and developed dashboards that could provide relevant information fast. Within hours, all efforts shifted to COVID-19. USDA had the first COVID dashboard operating two weeks later, overlaying COVID-19 case figures from Johns Hopkins University over existing HR data so USDA could understand where hot spots were occurring and their risk to its 100,000-person workforce. The new dashboard has since evolved to incorporate additional data to support data- driven workforce safety decisions and has been shared with multiple other federal agencies for reuse through the Federal CDO Council. In just a few weeks, these tools were delivered to nearly 5,000 leaders across the USDA, who now use the dashboard to make informed, risk-based decisions in a time of crisis–an accomplishment that would have been nearly impossible just a few years earlier. 28 The team has also built additional tools that directly support USDA’s program delivery to better serve American citizens during this time. For example, The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses a new dashboard for the Meals for Kids program, which assists families in finding free meals in their areas while schools are closed. Another dashboard helps USDA track the spending of nearly $19 billion appropriated to it by the CARES Act for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, which provides direct relief to American farmers and ranchers who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. Enabling Presumption of Access for Statistical Agencies The USDA data strategy and infrastructure is also helping to bridge the gap between administrative and statistical agencies by creating an environment where data, tools and compute power can be shared on a common platform to resolve major historical challenges."

In 2019, for example, major crop-producing areas in Illinois and the surrounding states experienced excess soil moisture due to above normal precipitation events and below normal temperatures. This caused historic delays in planting, late plantings, and increased prevent plant (acreage that farmers planned to plant to a specific crop but could not). Ultimately, there was a large difference from farmers’ March planting intentions to their final June planted acreages, differences substantiated by follow-on surveys conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). As insurance against future challenges, NASS began to explore leveraging novel technologies, more data sources, and new analytical methods to produce timelier indications of planted and prevent plant acreages. Although NASS has highly skilled geographers, mathematical statisticians, and data scientists dedicated to advanced research methods, NASS lacked the IT infrastructure, tools, and cloud computing capacity to use all available, useful data simultaneously. NASS was struggling to modernize its estimation methods and unable to develop and scale new national and state-level data models that leverage its own geospatial data products with emerging, timelier, and more granular satellite imagery data. NASS and USDA’s Statistical Officials partnered with the CDO and the EDAPT team to accomplish this task. In FY21, NASS worked closely with the CDO to confirm requirements, modernize, and launch its analytics capacities in EDAPT through the Integrated Modeling and Geospatial Estimation System (IMAGES) project."

CDO and NASS worked to fully enable NASS data scientists to use the platform for a variety of analytics workloads, which resulted in several direct and indirect benefits for NASS and USDA. In its research phase, IMAGES has increased the use and value of data on hand, increased the coverage of agricultural production resulting in process efficiencies, enhanced analytical capabilities, and added value to the workforce. The benefits are comprehensive. Increased value of the data on hand: IMAGES is expanding the use of collected data, both current and historical, providing added value to some products and resulting in some additional products. EDAPT also allows IMAGES to utilize all available non-survey data, including the following: ● Administrative data, such as Farm Service Agency (FSA) Form 578 (signup records), Risk Management Agency, and Agricultural Marketing Service data. 29 ● Geospatial data, including historic NASS Cropland Data Layers (CDLs) enhanced with FSA Common Land Unit (CLU) data. ● Economic data, such as recent and historic corn and soybean prices data as well as futures data. ● Environmental data, such as weather, climate, moisture, and soil type data."

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,5,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 1 Executive Summary Efective understanding of data quality is essential for public ofcials, private businesses, and the public to make data-driv­ en decisions. New sources of data, uses of existing data, analysis methods, and increasing reliance on integrating data from multiple sources bring new opportunities and challenges to federal agencies that provide information to support public and private decisions. Although new data sources and methods show great promise, the quality of these data must be evaluated. Inferior quality data can result in misleading information and poor decisions. A clear, documented understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of data assures attention to ameliorating the weakness­ es, enables appropriate uses of the data, and reinforces the credibility of the data and their use. All data have strengths and weaknesses across the multiple dimensions of data quality. Tese strengths and weaknesses typically involve trade-ofs of comprehensive coverage and accuracy versus timeliness and other quality dimensions. Data users who understand the ft­ ness-for-use of data are more likely to use them appropriately, whether for secondary use in developing other data products, for conducting data analysis, or when using data outputs for decision making. Te Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) has indicated that “agencies should work to adopt a common lan­ guage and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and derivative information they disseminate” (ICSP 2018)."

Te Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) has indicated that “agencies should work to adopt a common lan­ guage and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and derivative information they disseminate” (ICSP 2018). Tis report presents a framework for identifying data quality for all data, summarizes the current state of practice in iden­ tifying threats to data quality for the components of the framework, and provides guidance for promoting efective re­ porting of data quality. Statistical agencies in many countries have extensive, well-established methods for identifying and reporting threats to quality in data collected and designed for statistical purposes, particularly sample surveys. Methods are less well-developed for dealing with threats to quality from sources other than surveys, such as administrative records and readings from sensors, and other data originally collected for nonstatistical purposes. Background and Purpose In response to the rapidly changing world of data sources and analysis methods, the Federal Committee on Statistical Meth­ odology (FCSM) established a Data Quality Analysis Working Group to provide practical information on identifying and reporting data quality for federal agencies. Te group’s initial focus was to establish a comprehensive data quality frame­ work that provides an inventory of the elements (i.e., domains and dimensions) of data quality with a review of identifable threats to each dimension of data quality. Establishing such a framework was one of the key actions recommended by the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) Panel on Improving Federal Statistics for Policy and Social Science Research Using Multiple Data Sources and State-of-the-Art Estimation (CNSTAT 2017, 2018). In particular, CNSTAT noted that a useful framework needs to account for diferent dimensions of quality, such as timeliness and granularity, so that it can be used to consider tradeofs among multiple dimensions."

In particular, CNSTAT noted that a useful framework needs to account for diferent dimensions of quality, such as timeliness and granularity, so that it can be used to consider tradeofs among multiple dimensions. Other countries’ statistical leaders have defned frameworks to sup­ port guidance on identifying and reporting data quality (see e.g., Czajka and Stange 2018). Afer extensive considerations of international research and standards, the working group established a quality framework based on the 2000 Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000). Te Information Quality Act directed the Ofce of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue government-wide guidelines that “provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, util­ ity, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.” In OMB guidance, information quality is described as an overarching concept that includes Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of information. Tis guidance, along with elements that emerged in a commissioned report by Mathematica Policy Research that examined data quality frameworks and standards used outside the United States by national statistical ofces and international orga­ nizations, including the European Statistical System and a selection of individual European countries, Canada, Australia, FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 2 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), formed the basis for the FCSM Data Quality Framework."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,6,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 2 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), formed the basis for the FCSM Data Quality Framework. Te FCSM Data Quality Framework provides a common foundation upon which federal agencies can make decisions about the management of data products throughout their lifecycle by identifying and mitigating key data quality threats, evaluating trade-ofs among diferent quality dimensions where necessary, applying accepted methods at an appropriate level of rigor, and accounting for and reporting on the quality of data products and outputs. Tese activities all support appropriate and efective use of data. Wide application of these practices by all federal agencies is consistent with several OMB policy documents. For instance, OMB memorandum M-19-15, “Guidance on Improving Implementation of the Information Quality Act,” calls on agencies to document and disseminate information on the quality of administrative data that have the potential to be used for statistical purposes, to allow data users to determine the ftness-for-purpose of the data for use in secondary analysis (OMB 2019). Defning Data Quality Data quality is the degree to which data capture the desired information using appropriate methodology in a manner that sustains public trust. Tis defnition of data quality, informed by the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) and other sources, was developed by the FCSM for the purpose of the framework. It applies to all data: data collections and data systems; restricted and public use micro-data fles; data products produced through data integration, modeling, harmonization and other statistical analyses; and analysis outputs, such as tables, estimates, graphics and reports."

It applies to all data: data collections and data systems; restricted and public use micro-data fles; data products produced through data integration, modeling, harmonization and other statistical analyses; and analysis outputs, such as tables, estimates, graphics and reports. Data quality applies to the elements, or components, of data fles (e.g., variables, data felds), as well as to the entire data fle. It applies to existing methods such as traditional survey design, and new applications of established and emerging methods used to create FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 3 data fles, such as artifcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Te defnition applies to data produced from diferent types of input sources, including data collected for nonstatistical purposes, such as data from administrative records and sensors. Te defnition applies to integrated data products (i.e., record-linked data, modeled data), where integrated data can consist of statistical data, nonstatistical data, or a combination of data sources. Although the term integrated data is used in this report, this type of data are also described by other terms including blended data, multiple source, combined data, and linked data (when applicable). Components of Data Quality Data quality in this framework is considered using three broad components, or domains: utility, objectivity, and integrity."

Utility refers to the extent to which information is well-targeted to identifed and anticipated needs; it refects the usefulness of the information to the intended users. Objectivity refers to whether information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased, and is presented in an accurate, clear and interpretable, and unbiased manner. Integrity refers to the maintenance of rigorous scien­ tifc standards and the protection of information from manipulation or infuence as well as unauthorized access or revision. Te framework builds on these three domains, nesting 11 data quality dimensions within the domains, as shown below (Figure ES 1, Table ES 1). Te dimensions represent areas in which specifc aspects of data quality can be considered. Figure ES 1 illustrates the conception of data quality is quite broad, encapsulating most of the ideals that federal data providers try to uphold. Te quality dimensions are defned in Table ES 1.

Te quality domains and dimensions were informed from multiple published sources and agency experience and defned for use in this framework. Tis framework difers from data quality frameworks in other disciplines, such as computer and information science, because it focuses on the evaluation of the quality of data in the context of statistical use and decision making, rather than operational purposes. In other structures used to describe data quality, quality has sometimes been equated primarily with data accuracy. For exam­ ple, previous FCSM work has focused on various sources of sample survey error and the methods employed to measure and report them (e.g., FCSM 2001). Tese traditional sources of error remain important to track as the terrain is expanded to include secondary use of nonstatistical data and integrated data. However, accuracy is one of 11 dimensions of data quality in this framework, which highlights the importance of identifying the other dimensions. Threats to Data Quality Treats to data quality can be identifed for all of the dimensions within the framework, which is an essential step to facilitat­ ing their mitigation, managing trade-ofs among them, and for reporting data quality. Within the domain of utility, threats to data quality include competing data sources, costs of access and documentation, use of disclosure protections, and delays in data acquisition and processing. Most threats in the domain of objectivity are threats to accuracy and reliability, many of which (e.g., coverage error and nonresponse) are well-documented in the Total Survey Error paradigm (Biemer et al. 2017)."

Most threats in the domain of objectivity are threats to accuracy and reliability, many of which (e.g., coverage error and nonresponse) are well-documented in the Total Survey Error paradigm (Biemer et al. 2017). Although developed for surveys, these threats can be readily applied or adapted to most nonstatistical data. Increasing in importance are threats to accuracy and reliability for integrated data products, such as linkage error, harmonization error, and modeling error. Treats in the domain of integrity include lack of scientifc integrity, political interference, and data security failures. Many threats to data quality are relevant for multiple quality domains and dimensions. For instance, use of appropriate statistical methods reduces threats to all domains through dimensions of credibility, accuracy and reliability, and scientifc integrity. In some cases, mitigating threats in one area can exacerbate threats in others. Increasing granularity can increase disclosure risks. Timeliness and punctuality, for instance, can be reduced by steps taken to increase accuracy and reliability or by eforts to increase accessibility through documentation and dissemination."

Dimensions of Data Quality Domain Dimension Defnition Utility Relevance Relevance refers to whether the data product is targeted to meet current and prospective user needs. Accessibility Accessibility relates to the ease with which data users can obtain an agency’s products and documentation in forms and formats that are understandable to data users. Timeliness Timeliness is the length of time between the event or phenomenon the data describe and their availability. Punctuality Punctuality is measured as the time lag between the actual release of the data and the planned target date for data release. Granularity Granularity refers to the amount of disaggregation available for key data elements. Granularity can be expressed in units of time, level of geographic detail available, or the amount of detail available on any of a number of characteristics (e.g. (demographic, socio-economic)."

Granularity can be expressed in units of time, level of geographic detail available, or the amount of detail available on any of a number of characteristics (e.g. (demographic, socio-economic). Objectivity Accuracy and reliability Accuracy measures the closeness of an estimate from a data product to its true value. Reliability, a related concept, characterizes the consistency of results when the same phenomenon is measured or estimated more than once under similar conditions. Coherence Coherence is defned as the ability of the data product to maintain common defnitions, classifcation, and methodological processes, to align with external statistical standards, and to maintain consistency and comparability with other relevant data. Integrity Scientifc integrity Scientifc integrity refers to an environment that ensures adherence to scientifc standards and use of established scientifc methods to produce and disseminate objective data products and one that shields these products from inappropriate political infuence. Credibility Credibility characterizes the confdence that users place in data products based simply on the qualifcations and past performance of the data producer. Computer and physical security Computer and physical security of data refers to the protection of information throughout the collection, production, analysis, and development process from unauthorized access or revision to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsifcation. Confdentiality Confdentiality refers to a quality or condition of information as an obligation not to disclose that information to an unauthorized party."

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 5 Although single source data collections have one set of quality threats, quality threats for integrated data products include the quality threats for each input source, threats resulting from integration methods, and when applicable, threats identifed from additional statistical methods used to produce outputs (Brown et al. 2018, FCSM 2018). However, the net results on overall quality for integrated data may be best determined by aggregate assessment methods rather than by attempting to measure the cumulative consequences of each component and all possible interactions of components. In addition, threats to data quality for the original use of a data source may difer from those for its secondary use or use in integrated products. While the importance of each threat to quality varies across data collections, data products, and analy­ ses, the most signifcant threats to quality should be identifed and minimized as resources permit as they are likely to afect the ftness for use across a wide range of objectives. Best practices to identify threats to data quality include: • Regularly identify threats to data quality for ongoing data collections, particularly when considering new source data for inclusion. Decisions on trade-ofs among threats and mitigation measures should be considered in the context of the purpose of the data and all identifed threats. • For integrated data products, identify threats to data quality for all source data in the context of the purpose of the integrated data. Te quality of a data source for use in an integrated data product may difer from that for its original purpose."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,9,"• For integrated data products, identify threats to data quality for all source data in the context of the purpose of the integrated data. Te quality of a data source for use in an integrated data product may difer from that for its original purpose. • For integrated data products, evaluate the quality of the integration method, including record linkage, modeling, and harmonization. • For data outputs, including estimates in tables and reports, identify threats to data quality that arise from threats to the quality of the source data and from identifed threats resulting from analysis. • For some data outputs and integrated data products, measures of quality currently may be best identifed by evalu­ ations of critical processing and by evaluations of analysis decisions through sensitivity analysis, or by comparisons to benchmark or gold standard data. Te best level of detail for reporting data quality depends on the intended use and users of the information and the data product being documented. Quality reporting can take many forms, from detailed documentation about data collections to technical notes or footnotes accompanying a published statistic. Generally, reporting data quality for a particular data product or output will build on the documentation for the data collection from which it is derived and will include the documentation of additional quality assessments for any integration methods and statistical methods used to produce the output."

Generally, reporting data quality for a particular data product or output will build on the documentation for the data collection from which it is derived and will include the documentation of additional quality assessments for any integration methods and statistical methods used to produce the output. Detailed technical documentation is needed within a data collection program for continuity planning and parts of the detailed technical documentation can be extracted for various data products to meet the needs of diferent types of data users (e.g. National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) 2012). One example of this is the reuse of a subset of the con­ tent from the OMB Information Collection Request package to populate the Department’s Data Inventory, a project that is under development at the Department of Education (OMB 2019). Difering amounts of technical detail can be tailored to meet the needs of diferent types of data users. High-level summaries encapsulating the key quality issues are particularly important. In a few sentences, such a summary would provide an overview of the data product’s origin and describe its suit­ ability for a particular use and the likelihood that key data outputs could lead to misleading information. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 6 In summary, best practices for reporting on data quality include: • Provide detailed descriptions of the signifcance of each potential threat for internal use, what countermeasures, if any, are taken, and what trade-ofs or caveats are warranted. Citations to relevant studies that the agency or others have conducted to evaluate the threat and its likely impacts should be included."

Future Directions A wide variety of research is actively being conducted to identify new methods to meet emerging needs with the increasing use of data integration and secondary-use data to provide information for decision making. With integrated data, every phase of the process from data collection through dissemination is impacted. As agencies move these newly developed methods into production, ofen further research must be conducted to bridge the gap between a theoretical result and a method that will work well in a specifc production environment. At the same time, new metrics of assessing data quality for statistics arising from integrated data are being developed. Tis document refects the authors’ best understanding of the current status of the work as it impacts agencies in their eforts to produce quality ofcial statistics and future reports that build on the data quality framework will refect the numerous advances anticipated as agencies gain more experience with integrated and secondary-use data. Several topics and questions requiring additional study or research are identifed in this report, including: • Methods for assessing relevance and accessibility; • Determinants of response, measurement error and coverage error in nonstatistical data; • Methods for assessing the interaction between and among diferent types of quality threats; • Methods for identifying, evaluating, and measuring cumulative errors for integrated data; • Identifying characteristics of gold standard data for sensitivity analyses and another quality checks, including ‘truth decks’ for record linkage; • Methods for assessment and protection of disclosure risk; FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 7 • Methods for communicating and reporting quality across various audiences using new technologies and methods; and • Updated methods for creating templates and related tools for recording internal data quality documentation and converting that documentation into reports and data quality components of standard metadata that take advantage of new technologies (Statistical Community of Practice 2020).

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,16,"It has been estimated government data guide trillions of dollars of investments and generate billions for the private sector, each year (Beede et al. 2015). Federal agencies disseminate a wide range of data products that are used pervasively by the public, businesses, and governments to inform critical decisions (OMB 2018). Tese data products are produced from a variety of data systems, collections, and processes, and include data fles, online data tools for tabulations, analytic reports and other outputs. Traditionally, these products have been the result of statistical data collections designed for the purpose of creating statistics and other statistical products. Today, a major modernization efort within the federal statistical system is to acquire already collected program or administrative data from other parts of the government, or acquire data from nongovernmental sources, rather than initiating new, expensive and time-consuming data collections. As a result, data products increasingly include data originally collected for nonstatistical purposes as well as data sets that result from integrating one or more statistical and nonstatistical data products. Within the federal government, data are used in myriad ways (e.g., operational uses, performance monitoring, program evaluation, and policy formation). Federal data that are accessible, discoverable, and usable by the public have fueled entrepreneurship, innovation, and scien­ tifc discovery in a growing number of instances (OMB 2018). Tese advancements will continue to expand as innovative analytical tools are developed and data governance by federal agencies matures. Indeed, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (hereafer, the Evidence Act 2018) aims to advance the efectiveness of these data by better le­ veraging data as a strategic asset through improved governance, systematic planning of analyses, and increased sharing of valuable data assets."

Federal guidance to implement the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) emphasizes the concept of “ftness for purpose” as a touchstone for evaluating and communicating the quality of data made available to the public (OMB 2019a), noting that higher-impact uses of data require higher-quality data. Tis concept, also known as “ftness­ for-use,” is sometimes treated as a broad defnition of data quality. In a review of data quality in the international statistical community, Czajka and Stange (2018) note that the concept of data quality is almost universally associated with whether the data meets their intended purpose in operations, decision-making, and planning. In this view, data quality is best eval­ uated within the context of the intended uses of the data. However, data have always been used for purposes beyond those originally intended and opportunities for a wide range of secondary-use applications are increasingly being identifed and implemented by federal agencies. Data quality should be described sufciently to enable potential users to consider their ftness for their particular purposes. To do this requires a multidimensional approach, in which identifying and reporting on data quality entails answering a range of questions."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,16,"Data quality should be described sufciently to enable potential users to consider their ftness for their particular purposes. To do this requires a multidimensional approach, in which identifying and reporting on data quality entails answering a range of questions. For example: Are the data accurate and reliable? Do the data measure things of value at a useful level of detail? Can they be provided on time? Increasingly, federal agencies are sharing data and acquiring data from sources external to the government for secondary use, including to create integrated data products. Data quality for secondary-use data, that is, data initially collected for one purpose but used for another, can be challenging to assess comprehensively. Te statistical literature for ofcial statistics is most extensively developed around data collected for a particular use; for instance, statistical data collected through sample surveys (FCSM 2001). But this traditional literature does not cover all issues that are important for secondary uses of data and for the variety of integrated data products using these sources. Te statistical literature on the quality of integrated data continues to mature."

Te statistical literature on the quality of integrated data continues to mature. Although methods developing for record linked and modeled data can have general implications, FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 13 many of the recent contributions address the measurement of data quality within specifc contexts. Some of these lessons are analogous to the insights of the traditional, survey-based literature and some are entirely new. Unifying these ideas under a common framework is a way to facilitate their mutual development. In this report, FCSM provides a comprehensive data quality framework to support data quality identifcation and re­ porting by federal agencies. Te establishment of such a framework has been called for by the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) (CNSTAT 2017, 2018). Further, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) has stated that “agencies should work to adopt a common language and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and de­ rivative information they disseminate” (ICSP 2018)."

Further, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) has stated that “agencies should work to adopt a common language and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and de­ rivative information they disseminate” (ICSP 2018). Te framework establishes a common set of objectives for agencies to consider while managing data and provides a common language so that data quality reports and communications by diferent federal agencies may be more easily compared and synthesized. Some federal agencies have previously defned their own frameworks, and data quality principles, priorities, and approaches and it is relatively straightforward to map agency-specifc concepts to the common framework. Since the framework elaborates on a broad defnition of data quality to which all agencies must adhere, its application by federal agencies may expand their quality assessments to dimensions not previously addressed. Tis report puts forth a set of best practices developed by the FCSM for data producers to use in identifying and reporting on data quality. Data producers, for consistency within this report, are the data stewards, program managers and analysts who collect, acquire, process, manage, analyze, and disseminate data for statistical uses. Tese best practices apply to inter­ nal documentation needed for program continuity and to the information provided to the various users of data products and outputs. As there are many types of data products from federal agencies, there is a wide variety of users, from researchers who use complex micro-data fles to users of estimates disseminated in tables, reports, and other outputs for decision mak­ ing, evaluation and research. Te best practices in this report build on earlier FCSM reports focusing on the accuracy of survey data (FCSM 1988, 1990a, 1990b, 2001), extending these to all data as called for by the Federal Data Strategy (OMB 2019b, 2019c)."

Te implementation of best practices includes assessment of the primary threats to data quality in each of its dimensions, where threats are factors that reduce the quality of the data. Taking into account the variety of circumstances in which data are created and the variety of users who consume data quality reporting, the best practices describe the following actions: • Identifcation of threats to data quality. Detailed analysis should be conducted to identify particular threats to data quality using general approaches for assessment that are applicable to statistical and nonstatistical data sources as well as integrated data. • Reporting threats to data quality. Treats to each dimension of quality should be documented throughout the data lifecycle, as a part of normal business practice. Reporting should focus on the threats determined to have the most impact for a particular data product and its set of intended users, with potentially diferent levels of data quality reporting targeted to users with diferent needs. For integrated data, threats should be documented for input sources, integration methods, and outputs."

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 14 Te FCSM expects to continue its leadership in data quality issues by building on the framework and best practices de­ scribed in this report. Te curation of data quality is at the core of FCSM’s longstanding mission and its ongoing work. Pre­ vious FCSM reports describe best practices and have been considered authoritative sources for federal agencies and for the larger statistics profession.

FCSM acknowledges that there are other useful approaches to organizing a data quality framework. In particular, other sources discuss data quality in the context of cycles by which data are collected, processed, and released. For example, OMB’s Circular A-130 documents several stages through which information passes, including “collection, processing, dissemina­ tion, use, storage, and disposition, to include destruction and deletion” (OMB 2016, 29). In its 2017-18 sequence of work­ shops to gather insight on the data quality of integrated data products, the FCSM distinguished between three data life cycle stages (inputs, processing, and outputs) (Brown et al. 2018, FCSM 2018). Te life cycle and data-quality-framework perspectives for reporting quality to the user are not mutually exclusive.

Te framework readily applies to data collected for statistical purposes through sample surveys and censuses. Te framework can also be applied to nonstatistical data that are collected by governments and businesses in the course of their administration of programs, data that are created from transactions, and data that are obtained by satellites and sensors. It applies to integrated data created using statistical data, nonstatistical data or both. And, it applies to data products such as estimates and other data outputs obtained using standardized methods, as well as to the data fles that underlie such analyses. Although distinctions between data fles and outputs, such as estimates, can be made, in practice some data products produced as outputs may be used as inputs to other data products through secondary use or data integration. Te framework provides a common foundation upon which federal agencies can make decisions about the management of data collections throughout their lifecycle, evaluating trade-ofs among diferent quality dimensions where necessary. In par­ ticular, the framework provides a structure for identifying and addressing key data quality issues, applying accepted methods at an appropriate level of rigor, and for reporting on the quality of data products, supporting their efective use. Te framework is not novel—it synthesizes quality concepts currently employed by federal agencies, international organiza­ tions, and other authoritative bodies."

Te framework is not novel—it synthesizes quality concepts currently employed by federal agencies, international organiza­ tions, and other authoritative bodies. A review of precedents to its development is given in Appendix A. Data quality is the usefulness and credibility of data and products derived from data (e.g., statistics, analyses, and visualizations). Data and data products have high quality when they capture desired information using scientifcally appropriate methods to represent reality in a manner that sustains public trust. Tis defnition of data quality, in­ formed by the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) and other sources, was developed by the FCSM for the purpose of the framework. Te defnition contains three broad components, highlighted in the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) and referenced in this framework as the domains of data quality: utility, objectivity, and integrity.1 Defnitions of the domains of data quality used in this framework are in Table 2.1. As with the defnition of data quality, defnitions of the components were developed for the framework by the FCSM using the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) and through careful review of documents and reports from national and international statistical agencies and organizations."

Timeliness Timeliness is the length of time between the event or phenomenon the data describe and their availability. Punctuality Punctuality is measured as the time lag between the actual release of the data and the planned target date for data release.

A related concept is reliability, which characterizes the consistency of results when the same phenomenon is measured or estimated more than once under similar conditions. Coherence Coherence is defned as the ability of the data product to maintain common defnitions, classifcation, and methodological processes, to align with external statistical standards, and to maintain consistency and comparability with other relevant data. Integrity Scientifc integrity Scientifc integrity refers to an environment that ensures adherence to scientifc standards and use of established scientifc methods to produce and disseminate objective data products and one that shields these products from inappropriate political infuence. Credibility Credibility characterizes the confdence that users place in data products based simply on the qualifcations and past performance of the data producer. Computer and physical security Computer and physical security of data refers to the protection of information throughout the collection, production, analysis, and development process from unauthorized access or revision to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsifcation. Confdentiality Confdentiality refers to a quality or condition of information as an obligation not to disclose that information to an unauthorized party.

Tis is an approximation. In practice, some dimensions may have implications for more than one domain. For example: • Scientifc integrity and credibility in a federal data program have a direct efect on the integrity domain but they also afect the utility of data products produced. • Treats to a data product’s accuracy and reliability will directly impact its objectivity, but this will, in turn, afect the credibility, and thus the integrity, of its published estimates. In this framework, the domains are essentially goals for data stewards, data program managers, and analysts, and the dimen­ sions are the more specifc objectives. An objective can serve more than one goal.

High levels of utility result when agencies take potential uses of the information into consideration while designing measures for production. Utility is enhanced by continual assessment of information needs, the anticipation of emerging requirements, and the development of new data products and services to meet those needs and requirements (OMB 2006). Utility is related closely to the term “usefulness”—the extent to which the data meet the needs of their users. It encompasses whether the data are of interest, the ease by which users can access and use the data, and whether the data are credible with the users. Note that utility does not include how well the data approximate the intended indicator—such considerations are included in the objectivity domain. As shown in Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2, the utility domain includes fve quality dimensions: relevance, accessibility, timeliness, punctuality, and granularity. Tese are defned in the subsections below. Relevance Relevance refers to whether the data product is targeted to meet current and prospective user needs.

As summarized by Czajka and Stange (2018) in their review of international guidelines and standards for data quality reporting, alignment with the needs of users is ofen seen in defnitions of relevance in many national statistical organizations, including Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada 2017), the European Statistical System (European Statistical System 2020), and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009). Te Evidence Act defnes relevant statistical information as “processes, activities, and other such matters likely to be useful to policymakers and public and private sector data users” (Pub. L. No. 115-435, 132 Stat. 5529, 2018 codifed at 44 USC 3563(d)(4)). FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 22 Accessibility Accessibility relates to the ease with which data users can obtain an agency’s products and documentation in forms and formats that are understandable to data users."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,26,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 22 Accessibility Accessibility relates to the ease with which data users can obtain an agency’s products and documentation in forms and formats that are understandable to data users. Two main class­ es of activity support the accessibility of a data product: making the data product available to a broad range of users in easy-to-use formats and providing metadata and other documentation to facilitate the use and interpretation of the data (Statistical Community of Practice 2020). Doc­ umentation also provides users with information about the quality of the data. Data products have high availability when they are provided in discoverable, open (nonpropri­ etary) formats that are accessible to users with vision or other impairments (ICSP 2018), and when users costs associated with access are limited (Statistics Canada 2000). Indeed, Title 2 of the Evidence Act requires public government data to be accessible (Pub. L. No. 115-435, 132 Stat. 5529, 2018, codifed at 44 USC 3562 (d)(3)). Agencies can also enhance availability by using plain language geared to the intended audience to clearly and correctly present all informa­ tion products (OMB 2006), and by ensuring that ofcial statistics are disseminated in forms that enable and encourage analysis and reuse (United Kingdom Statistics Authority 2018). Timeless Timeliness is the length of time between the event or phenomenon the data describe and the availability of the data."

Timeless Timeliness is the length of time between the event or phenomenon the data describe and the availability of the data. Statistical Policy Directive No. 4, (OMB 2008, 12625) directs fed­ eral statistical agencies to “minimize the interval between the period to which the data refer and the date when the product is released to the public.” According to European Statistical System (2020), when a data collection requests data for a specifed prior reference period, timeliness includes the period between the reference period and the date when the data are collected plus the production period from the end of data collection until the release of the frst product. Punctuality Punctuality is measured as the time lag between the actual release of the data and the planned target date for data release. Tis is important for meeting user expectations (espe­ cially legislated deadlines) and by precluding even the appearance of political interference in a scheduled release (OMB 1985, 2008). Punctuality can be expressed through a dichotomous measure of whether a data product was released on schedule, that is, the data release was either punctual or not (Czajka and Stange 2018). Punctuality encourages users to depend on data products because their timing can be anticipat­ ed and used for planning. Punctuality to the nearest second is important for data releases that move markets and are the subject of automated trading in the stock market. A performance measure for some agencies and data programs, e.g., the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), is the percentage of reports released on schedule."

A performance measure for some agencies and data programs, e.g., the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), is the percentage of reports released on schedule. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 23 Granularity refers to the amount of disaggregation available for key data elements. Granu­ larity can be expressed in units of time; level of geographic detail available; or the amount of detail available on any of a number of characteristics. Tis defnition builds on CNSTAT (2018) where granularity is defned as “the degree to which estimates can be obtained for small subdivisions of the population, such as spatial subdivisions or diferent socioeconomic status Granularity categories.” Granularity is valuable to users when variations over space (e.g., block level, town or city, county, state), time (e.g., monthly, quarterly or annual), and other characteristics (e.g., categories of race and ethnicity, gender identity, and socio-economic status of individuals; size and industry of establishments) are meaningful. For example, consider the temporal granularity of travel. When averaged over a year, crowded holiday travel disappears, and when averaged over a day, rush hour congestion in urban areas is canceled by empty streets at night (Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) 2019). Analogous considerations can afect analyses of phenomena that may vary over space or between groups: Do aggregate statistics for a state mask conditions of a city within the state?"

Analogous considerations can afect analyses of phenomena that may vary over space or between groups: Do aggregate statistics for a state mask conditions of a city within the state? Do measures of health, education, and justice difer by race, ethnicity, age, gender, or socioeconomic status? Do annual estimates mask seasonal variation? Objectivity Objectivity refers to whether information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased, and is presented in an accurate, clear, and unbiased manner. Objectivity applies to both the substance of and the presentation of the information. Objectivity is achieved by using sound statistical and research methods to generate data and develop analytical re­ sults (OMB 2002, 8459). Te objectivity domain includes the data characteristics that are most traditionally and intuitively associated with data quality. Are the data based on sound methods of measurement that accurately capture the objects they claim to measure? Are the indictors/estimates presented in an accurate way?"
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,27,"Are the data based on sound methods of measurement that accurately capture the objects they claim to measure? Are the indictors/estimates presented in an accurate way? Tese two elements—substance and presenta­ tion—are described in OMB’s defnition of objectivity. Te Evidence Act reinforces this defnition, referring to ob­ jective statistical activities as those that are “accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased.” Note that some sources include the provision of documentation as part of objectivity (see, e.g., OMB 2014, 71615). However, under this framework, documentation is primarily a contributor to accessibility—a dimension of the utility domain—as it relates directly to the users’ experience with the data that are produced, rather than the production of the data itself. As shown in Figure 2.2 and Table 2.2, the objectivity domain comprises two quality dimensions: a) accuracy and reliability, and b) coherence. Tese are defned in the subsections below.

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,28,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 24 Accuracy and Reliability Accuracy and reliability Coherence Coherence Accuracy measures the closeness of an estimate from a data product to its true value. A related concept is reliability, which characterizes repeated estimates of accuracy over time. For an estimate to be accurate, all components of the data product need to be accurate. While accuracy can apply to an entire data fle or data collection, many common measures, includ­ ing standard errors and other measures of precision, apply to estimates. Accuracy for outputs of integrated data depends on the accuracy of source data and linkage or modeling errors that result from the integration process. Reliability, a related concept, characterizes the consistency of results when the same phenomenon is measured or estimated more than once under similar conditions. Te concepts of accuracy and reliability are closely related. Te Evidence Act defnes accurate sta­ tistics as those that “consistently match the events and trends being measured” (Pub. L. No. 115­ 435, 132 Stat."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,28,"Te Evidence Act defnes accurate sta­ tistics as those that “consistently match the events and trends being measured” (Pub. L. No. 115­ 435, 132 Stat. 5529, 2018, codifed at 44 USC 3563 (d)(1)), Some sources simply cite the concepts in tandem, Czajka and Stange (2018, vix) state that “accuracy and reliability refer to the degree to which statistical information correctly describes the phenomena it was designed to measure.” A tandem characterization is also known as construct validity in the evaluation literature (Cook and Campbell 1979, Shadish et al. 2001). Coherence is defned as the ability of the data product to maintain common defnitions, classifcation, and methodological processes, to align with external statistical standards, and to maintain consistency and comparability with other relevant data. Coherence applies to data over time, across key domains and when data originate from diferent internal and ex­ ternal sources. Tere are many defnitions of coherence used to describe data. Te defnition of coherence for the framework is similar to that used in FCSM (2001) from Depoutot and Arondel (1999): “the ability of the statistical data program to maintain common defnitions, classifcations, and methodological standards when data originate from several sources.” Com­ parability of statistics, which the FCSM defnes as “the ability to make reliable comparisons over time,” is a subset of coherence (FCSM 2001). According to Statistical Policy Directive 2, “(a) consistent data series maintains comparability over time by keeping an item fxed, or by incorpo­ rating appropriate adjustment methods in the event an item is changed.”"

When change is required, coherence requires that appropriate methods to bridge across the change be developed and documented. For the framework, coherent data products, whether from national surveys, statistical and non- statistical sources or integrated products, are consistent and comparable with other relevant data sources of known and documented quality, across key subdomains, and over time.

Integrity is a domain that captures wheth­ er data products are produced and managed appropriately. Te integrity of a data product can be afected by the attributes of the data producer. Promoting integrity entails safeguarding data from improper use, whether through manipulation of handling, estimation and dissemination processes, unauthorized access, or re-identifcation of con­ fdential data elements. Te Information Quality Act defnes integrity as “the protection of information from unau­ thorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsifcation.” (Pub.

Tese are defned in the subsections below. Scientific integrity Scientifc integrity refers to an environment that ensures adherence to scientifc standards and use of established scientifc methods to produce and disseminate objective data prod­ ucts and one that shields these products from inappropriate political infuence. Te “State­ ment of Commitment to Scientifc Integrity by Principal Statistical Agencies” (Principal Statis­ tical Agencies 2012) supports the breadth of factors that contribute to the integrity of ofcial data products: “Methodological improvements and rigorous approaches to data collection and analysis require the application of scientifc methods. Computer scien­ tists, demographers, economists, geographers, mathematicians, survey statis­ ticians, and other scientists are needed for producing high quality, objective statistics from surveys or administrative data. Subject area experts, such as epidemiologists and engineers, are also needed to maximize data quality. Re­ search and methodological innovation are required to continuously improve the quality and scope of our data products while protecting privacy and en­ suring confdentiality. All of the above mentioned factors are critically im­ portant to ensuring the credibility of Federal statistical agencies” (Principal Statistical Agencies 2012).

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 26 Credibility Credibility Credibility Computer and Physical Security Computer Computer and physical and physical security security Credibility characterizes the confdence that users place in data products based simply on the qualifcations and past performance of the data producer. In other words, credibility is an attribute of a data producer that is attached to the products that the producer disseminates. Perceptions of data users about the reputations of data producers and their products have a di­ rect impact on the integrity of the data product. An important aspect of credibility is “trust in the objectivity of the data.” (Czajka and Stange 2018, 55) OMB Statistical Policy Directive 1: Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agen­ cies and Recognized Statistical Units (Directive 1) highlights the essential role that credibility plays in the utility of data disseminations (OMB 2014, 71610): “Te Nation relies on the fow of credible statistics to support the decisions of individ­ uals, households, governments, businesses, and other organizations. Any loss of trust in the relevance, accuracy, objectivity, or integrity of the Federal statistical system and its products can foster uncertainty about the validity of measures our Nation uses to monitor and assess performance, progress, and needs.” Although Directive 1 establishes credibility as a fundamental responsibility of statistical agen­ cies and units, it is a goal for any agency disseminating data."

Computer and physical security of data refers to the protection of information throughout the collection, production, analysis, and development process from unauthorized access or revision to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsifca­ tion. Tis defnition is based on prior OMB guidance (OMB 2002, 2006) and the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000). Te Information Quality Act indicates that agencies may rely on their implementation of the federal government’s computer security laws “to establish appropriate security safeguards for ensuring the integrity of the information that the agencies disseminate” (OMB 2002). Similarly, the United Nations also requires an IT-secu­ rity policy to be in place “for the protection and security of personal data” and that the IT-secu­ rity policy must ensure that “Statistical agencies secure adequate survey methods and processing methods and guarantee that data are not falsifed by human or technical misbehaviour.” (United Nations 2015, 57). Physical security can complement computer security. Te European Commission (2011) re­ quires that “Physical, technological and organizational provisions are in place to protect the security and integrity of statistical databases.”"

Tis defnition is from the Evidence Act (Pub. L. No. 115-435, 132 Stat. 5529, 2018, codifed at 44 USC 3563(d)(4)) and is con­ sistent with requirements that individually-identifable data be protected from unauthorized disclosure in order to uphold its confdentiality (OMB 2006), in which individually-identi­ fable data are those that permit the identity of the respondent or entity to which the infor­ mation apply to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. Many international statistical agencies and organizations also identify confdentiality as a key value. For example, the United Kingdom’s Statistical Authority (2018 9) states that “Private information about individual persons (including bodies corporate) compiled in the production of ofcial statistics is confdential and should be used for statistical purposes only.”"

However, the discussion is not exhaustive. Future FCSM reports and case studies may build on the framework to provide additional insights. Utility As described in Chapter 2, data products have high utility when they target the informational needs of key users, elicit the trust of those users, are provided in a way that users can easily access and apply, are recent enough to be actionable, are provided on schedule, and have an appropriate level of detail. Tese factors determine their potential value to the user for given levels of other dimensions, particularly accuracy. Note that a high-utility data product can have signifcant value to some users even if its accuracy is limited; however, the limitations need to be taken into consideration and documented. If a data product answers a key question for which no other information is available, it may be usefully applied to make key decisions when the limitations of the data do not have a major impact on how the data are used."

If a data product answers a key question for which no other information is available, it may be usefully applied to make key decisions when the limitations of the data do not have a major impact on how the data are used. By the same token, a highly accurate data product may have little value to users if they do not need the information, if they have alternative ways of getting it, or if it is provided too late. Te diferent uses that a data set might be put to requires that utility be evaluated according in terms of multiple uses. Tis requirement complicates the assessment of utility and requires agencies to have a good understanding of user needs. Relevance To be relevant, a data product’s scope, coverage, reference period, geographic detail, data items, clas- sifcations, and methodology must meet user needs. Relevance is threatened when agencies do not understand the needs of users and when other data products fll those needs. Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) guidelines support utility by stressing the need for each agency to take public uses of information into consideration along with the agency’s own intended uses (OMB 2002, 8451).

No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) identifes several steps that federal agencies should take to ensure that disseminated information meets the needs of the intended users, including: • Conduct internal reviews, analyses, and evaluations • Request feedback from advisory committees, researchers, policymakers and the public • Identify the audience for each information product Agencies gather information about the relevance of their data products to users through a variety of tracking measures, e.g., the number of downloads and frequency of citations in scientifc literature and the popular media. In addition, they gather feedback through a variety of means (e.g., environ- mental scans, survey-based tests, and expert panels) to anticipate changes in user needs and identify unmet needs that have already emerged. Internal reviews and analyses can also provide some sense of the usefulness of a data product. For example, the passage of the Afordable Care Act prompted FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 31 Relevance Relevance Relevance Accessibility Accessibil Accessibility ity agencies to conduct studies to identify relevant gaps in the available data for health insurance cover­ age (see, e.g., Health and Human Services (HHS) Data Council 2011, Rabe et al. 2016, Schildkraut et al. 2015).

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,35,"Te availability of related data products. If similar information on a particular subject is readily available through alternative channels, a given data product may not be critically important. Consequently, changes in the availability of other sources of data (i.e., new and emerging sources) can create a need for data producers to re-evaluate the relevance of a data product. For example, as price indices derived from private sources have grown in feasibility and use, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has engaged with the developers of these private indices to ensure its understanding of how they afect the value of BLS’s price indices. Tis threat is related to similar threats to the dimension coherence, which is also afected by the availability of related data products. 3. Negative perceptions of users. Subjective perceptions and understandings afect relevance, especially if users do not understand the applicability of a given data product to their needs. Tis threat is also associated with the scientifc integrity and credibility dimensions in the domain integrity, through the threats of obsolescence and political interference. Accessibility relates to the ease with which data users can obtain an agency’s products and documen­ tation in forms and formats that are understandable and interpretable to data users.

Data and supporting documentation must also be preserved through good archival practice to be accessible in the future. Providing metadata facilitates the use and inter­ pretation of data, and increases their accessibility (Statistical Community of Practice 2020). Accessi­ bility is threatened by high costs to access data or documentation, when disclosure limitation methods are applied, and when data products are confused with others in web-based searches for information. One example of a successful efort to improve the accessibility of a large dataset is NASA’s Big Earth Data Initiative. One focus of this Initiative was to standardize the formats, interfaces and protocols of federally funded, earth-observing data, using community input on the standards, in order to increase the interoperability of such data. Te Initiative enhanced discoverability of these data by ensuring that NASA’s earth-observing data were complete, searchable, and conformed to international standards.

Interpret- ability is supported when data are accompanied by “full and frank commentary” (United Kingdom Statistics Authority 2018). Documentation should contain information about data quality, partic­ ularly identifying threats to data quality with the most impact, enabling ftness-for-use assessments (Statistics Canada 2000). High-quality documentation facilitates reproducibility, the ability to obtain consistent results from the same input data. Reproducibility is a key feature of high-quality data that supports credibility among users and allows improvements in data processes. CNSTAT recommends several steps for improving reproducibility (CNSTAT 2019a, 2019b) and urges agencies to fully document the processes used to produce and disseminate statistical products, and to take proactive steps to preserve data for future use. Tis documentation should include concepts, defnitions, data collection methods, and describe factors that afect data quality.

OMB guidance emphasizes the need for documentation at every stage of the data lifecycle (OMB 2006). Internal documentation can be used to tailor additional reports on various data products, including data fles and data outputs. Documentation of data quality for integrated data will include reference to documentation available for each input data source, documentation of integration and other statistical methods employed, and documentation of any outputs obtained. Finally, high-quality data documentation is also important for supporting subject matter and tech­ nical research that may expand the usability of the data. Such documentation may include con­ sultation, training, and technical assistance in addition to the contextual and process information described above. Treats to Accessibility 1.

Data users may gain access to restricted data through special arrangements, such as those provided by Federal Statistical Research Data Centers—facilities for access to restricted-use micro data (Cen­ sus Bureau 2020)—but such arrangements typically require time and expense to utilize. While costs are incurred, without access through Research Data Centers, access would not be available without threatening confdentiality, a dimension in the integrity domain. 2. Use of disclosure limitation methods. A variety of techniques are available to mask individ­ ual responses when making confdential data available to the public (see, e.g., Abowd and Schmutte 2019). Although disclosure limitation methods provide a way to maintain conf­ dentiality and allow data access in support of the quality principles related to these character­ istics, the methods afect accuracy and reliability, a dimension in the objectivity domain, and may afect dimensions timeliness and granularity in the utility domain.

Discoverability of a data product may be challenged when data catalogs and web-based searches include the data product, but it is difcult to identify in a mass of other, similar, entries. At the same time, when a data product does not use a standardized set of formats and metadata standards, potential users may discover only some subsets of the data product without recognizing other subsets. Timeliness is the length of time between the event or phenomenon the data describe and their avail­ ability. Data producers consider tradeofs between timeliness and other quality dimensions when determining what data products to create and how to create and document them. Timeliness is threatened by the availability of essential source data needed for the data products, processing time, the application of high levels of statistical rigor, and the preparation of documentation. Treats to timeliness are greater for phenomena and data products that change over time compared to those that change little over time. Approaches for improving timeliness depend on the data product and the threat. Some approaches may include the release of provisional data, the use of models to estimate current conditions based on stable trends, by use of early returns from key respondents, and by the use of surrogate measures. One example of an agency’s approach to balancing competing priorities between timeliness and other quality dimensions is demonstrated by the “release cycle” the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) uses to disseminate estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)."

Successively updated vintages of GDP estimates exemplify increasing accuracy as timeliness decreases (see the discussion in Prell et al. 2019, 29). Another approach that some agencies are considering is the use of forecasting models to generate predicted values of measures whose true values are only known with a lag. Such “nowcasting” models may exploit auxiliary information to anticipate movements in the ofcial measure (see, e.g., Cajner et al. 2019, Glaeser et al. 2019, and NCHS 2020a). Similarly, the NASS uses statistical models to com­ bine its survey data on crop yields with administrative and weather data to produce forecasts for the primary crops (see, e.g., Adrian 2012, Cruze 2016, Cruze and Benecha 2017).

Although documentation is a threat to timeliness, the availability of comprehensive documentation can improve timeliness of subsequent releases of the same product for data producers and it increases accessibility and credibility, which are dimensions in the utility domain. Punctuality is measured as the time lag between the actual release of the data and the planned target date for data release. It can be expressed through a dichotomous measure of whether a data product was released on schedule; that is, the data release was either punctual or not (Czajka and Stange 2018). Punctuality is an expectation that increases utility and integrity with a transparent schedule that conveys that data releases will not be delayed, including for political reasons."

Concatenating multiple data sources over time can potentially improve granularity by increasing the number of observations within subsamples of interest if key estimates are thought to be stable over time. Identifying alternative data sources for secondary use or integration can mitigate some threats by providing more detail for subgroups. However, integrating data sources can also diminish the granularity if data require coarsening for harmonization or to align coverage. Te granularity in a data collection or restricted-access data fle may difer from the granularity in publicly released data. To balance confdentiality and granularity, agencies may choose to use disclosure avoidance techniques or establish special user access provisions as highlighted under ac­ cessibility.

Tis report considered several concepts of objectivity related to data quality but focused on the measurement and reporting of various error sources that afect data quali­ ty: sampling error, nonresponse error, coverage error, measurement error, and processing error. Accuracy and reliability Accuracy measures the closeness of an estimate, including direct and modeled estimates, to its true value (FCSM 2001, Eurostat 2020). Accuracy of an estimate is dependent on the accuracy of its com­ ponents. While some measures of accuracy apply to an entire data fle or data collection (e.g., response rate), standard errors and other measures of precision apply to estimates. Accuracy for outputs of in­ tegrated data depends on the accuracy of source data and linkage or modeling errors that result from the integration process.

Treats to accuracy and reliability are briefy described below, drawn, in part, from the terminol­ ogy of the Total Survey Error paradigm (e.g., Biemer et al. 2017, Groves et al. 2009) and building from FCSM (2001), including sampling error, coverage error, measurement error and nonresponse error.

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 37 Treats to accuracy can be described as various “types” or “sources” of errors, which can reduce accuracy by diminishing either statistical unbiasedness, precision, or both. Te accuracy of a data product refects the accuracy of the input sources and all processing and calculations performed to transform those data into outputs.

Data producers identify and report on the impact of many factors as a normal course of business. For example, OMB standards for survey data (OMB 2006) discuss the importance of: • Measuring accuracy of the sampling frame and its impact on the survey frame; • Measuring accuracy of data items; • Evaluating accuracy of forecasting models or derivation procedures; • Evaluating the accuracy of assumptions and limitations, calculations, and formulas used to create estimates; and, • Evaluating accuracy of estimates by comparing estimates with other information sources. Similar actions are applicable to other statistical data, secondary uses of nonstatistical data, and in­ tegrated data. However, when identifying and reporting quality for secondary-use data, over which agencies have less control, the needed information may not be available. Accuracy and reliability for outputs of survey and other statistical data are frequently reported using traditional measures like standard errors and response rates that capture statistical bias and preci­ sion. Statistical bias and precision are described in Appendix B. Briefy, statistical unbiasedness refers to a condition where “the expected value of an estimate of a characteristic is equal to the true popu­ lation value” (CNSTAT 2018, 40). Te phrase “expected value of an estimate” refers to a value that would emerge if the population were sampled and re-sampled many times, the estimate calculated for each sample, and an average (expected value) of all sample estimates calculated from all the pos­ sible samples. Statistical precision, defned as the inverse of the variance, indicates the variability of an estimate and is related to the errors, or threats, that afect variance and standard errors, including sampling error and modeling error. Estimates with high statistical precision have lower variance and are more accurate than those with low statistical precision."

For integrated data products, incorporating errors for all inputs and processing steps is ideal but may not be feasible. Potential approaches for measuring accuracy and reliability for integrated data and similarly complex data products include: a) direct comparisons to an external gold standard; b) bench­ marking with known subject-specifc and other relevant information; and c) conducting sensitivity analyses, such as evaluations of critical processing, analysis decisions, and modeling assumptions. Treats to Accuracy and Reliability 1. Sampling error. Sample surveys rely on a subset of a population to support estimates that represent the whole population.

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,42,"For surveys, this occurs when selected survey participants do not respond. Broken equipment creates missing data for sensors and other automated instruments. If units with particular characteristics are less likely to respond or less likely to have complete data, then estimates based on the collected data may be biased. A recent FCSM report describes methods used to assess the efects of nonresponse in federal surveys (FCSM 2020). Even when nonresponse and missing data are random, resulting estimates are based on a smaller number of collected observations. 3. Coverage error. For sample surveys, coverage error occurs when the sampling frame difers from the target population. Substantial coverage errors afect the utility of the data for inferences about the target population. Coverage error applies to secondary use of nonstatistical data when the universe from which the data were originally collected does not match the target population of the intended data product. 4.

Measurement error. Measurement error is defned as the diference between the observed value of a variable and the true, but unobserved, value of that variable and as the variance (or standard deviation) of that diference. 5. Linkage error. Linkage error includes the possible types of errors that emerge from the linkage process itself, such as false matches or missed matches, that are not attributable to either data source independently. 6. Harmonization error. Harmonization errors arise when data elements have been defned, collected, or processed diferently. For single source data products, harmonization errors afect consistency of the data over time. For integrated data products, diferences in data elements across input sources can lead to harmonization error. 7. Modeling error."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,42,"For integrated data products, diferences in data elements across input sources can lead to harmonization error. 7. Modeling error. For modeled data products and outputs, modeling errors arise from inaccuracies in statistical model assumptions and from the efects of modeling decisions related to missing data, calibration variables and other constants, infuential observations, and other factors. Modeling error can difer among statistical outputs from the same data product, including estimates produced for population domains and/or produced at various geographic and temporal resolutions (see additional threats to accuracy and reliability for geographic data below). In some instances, modeling errors can be evaluated and mitigated through combining models, a process sometimes called ensemble modeling, if the models are based on diferent but documented assumptions (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020, Seni and Elder 2010). Treats from modeling error can be exacerbated by measures to mitigate threats to timeliness and punctuality in the utility domain. 8. Processing error. Processing error occurs during the processes that convert collected data into data products, including data fles, integrated data and data outputs.

Additional Treats to Accuracy and Reliability Involving Geographic Data. Data that characterize geographic locations are afected by the geometry of boundaries, the ease of overextending data precision with geographic information systems technology, and the frequent use of neighborhood characteristics as a proxy for characteristics of individuals (Schmitt 1978). Treats to accuracy involving geographic data in the objectivity domain are closely tied to the dimension granularity in the utility domain. Coherence is the ability of the statistical data to maintain common defnitions, classifcation, and methodological processes; to align with external statistical standards; and to maintain consistency and comparability with other relevant data over time, across key domains, and when data originate from diferent internal and external sources. For surveys and statistical data collected by an agency, the use of validated questions and question-response research can increase coherence."

For example, see the Q-bank collection of question evaluation studies (e.g., NCHS 2020b). For nonstatistical data, toolkits are being developed that can be used as a starting point when assessing the accept­ ability of the coherence and other quality dimensions for data prior to use (Iwig 2013, Murphy and Konny 2017, Seeskin 2019). Treats to coherence are summarized below. Each of these threats also afect accuracy and reliability and the dimensions accessibility and relevance in the utility domain. Treats to Coherence 1. Multiple sources of data and defnitions. Information for the same constructs may be collected diferently among surveys and other statistical data collections.

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 40 Integrity Te National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) identi­ fed four principles for federal statistical agencies in its publication, “Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency.” Tese principles are fundamental to ensuring the integrity of ofcial statistics: (1) objectivity of information produced, (2) credibility with those who use the data and information, (3) trust of those who provide information, and (5) independence within the government. Treats to integrity are associated with failing to uphold one or more of these principles. Tis section discusses threats to quality dimensions within the integrity domain: scientifc integ­ rity, credibility, computer and physical security, and confdentiality. Scientifc integrity refers to an environment that ensures adherence to scientifc standards and use of established scientifc methods to produce and disseminate objective data products and one that shields these products from inappropriate political infuence. Te “Statement of Commitment to Scientifc Integrity by Principal Statistical Agencies” (Principal Statistical Agencies 2012) supports the breadth of factors that contribute to the integrity of ofcial data products. Treats to scientifc integrity vary in scope and impacts from political interference and obsolescence to computer-gen­ erated data."

Treats to scientifc integrity vary in scope and impacts from political interference and obsolescence to computer-gen­ erated data. To maintain scientifc rigor, it is a continuing challenge to identify the most relevant newly available data sources and to develop methods that take full advantage of the additional information they provide. At the same time, consideration must be given to the potential for these data sources to be disrupted or for their content or scope to change, especially if they are obtained from the private sec­ tor. Changes and inconsistencies with external data sources could result in the scientifc integrity of the released information being compromised if those changes are not considered in the production of the data product; unstable external source data also threatens coherence in the utility domain. Treats to Scientifc Integrity 1. Political interference. Interference in the publication of statistics, or even the appearance of such interference, can threaten the scientifc integrity of a data product. Political interference is also a threat to credibility, another dimension in the integrity domain, and it afects perceptions of the data by users, a threat to relevance in the utility domain. 2. Obsolescence."

Obsolescence. Te best available scientifc and statistical methods must be used to obtain data and produce data products. If these methods do not evolve, over time processes that once led to scientifcally rigorous data and information become dated and diminish the scientifc integrity of the data products. Obsolescence also afects the dimension of credibility within the integrity domain and the dimensions of accuracy and reliability within the objectivity domain. Employing new methods, however, can reduce coherence with prior data products, another dimension in the objectivity domain. 3. Computer-Generated Data. Bots, sofware applications that run automated tasks or scripts over the internet, have the potential to provide inaccurate information to surveys (Dupuis et al. 2019, Chandler et al. 2017), possibly harming the objectivity and credibility of the published statistics.

Te use of bots is likely to be low or nonexistent for probability sampled federal surveys but has yet to be fully studied for these and many other types of statistical and nonstatistical data. Tis threat can afect the credibility dimension in the utility domain, and the accuracy and reliability dimension in the objectivity domain. Credibility is primarily a matter of trust. Do users trust the producer of the statistical products to provide an accurate and objective measure? As data produced by a trusted entity have more utility than the same data produced by a nontrusted entity, the organization’s credibility transfers to the product. Credibility is derived from many aspects of quality inherent in a provider’s range of data outputs, so the threats to credibility echo those of the other quality dimensions. Agencies can in­ crease credibility by ensuring that the methods used are transparent, understandable, and rooted in accepted theory."

Treats to credibility are varied and include the release of inaccurate and or unreliable products, competing data sources and methods, political interference, and obsolescence such as production of outdated products or use of outdated methods. Some key practices for maintaining credibility have been recommended and include: • Regular use of sound statistical methods (OMB 2014, 71615); • Regularly evaluating of an agency’s statistical products (OMB, 2014, 71615); • Regularly providing transparency through clear descriptions of how data are collected or estimated, of assumptions that are made, and of any known data errors and limitations (National Research Council 2017, OMB 2014, 71615); • Regularly making data and the information needed for users to work with the data widely available on an equal basis to all users (National Research Council 2017); • Seeking input from all types of data users (National Research Council 2017); • Making a strong commitment to professional practice (National Research Council 2017); • Cultivating a reputation for good management and efciency (European Commission 2011); and • Demonstrating independence from undue political interference in the production, dissemination, and analysis of statistical data (European Commission 201, National Research Council 2017, OMB 2014). Treats to Credibility 1. Dissemination of inaccurate data products."

Inaccuracies and errors impact the confdence that data users place in the data product and can afect their trust in other data products released by the agency. Users assign greater credibility to polls and other data products that have a history of accuracy (see, e.g., Kennedy et al. 2018). All threats to accuracy and reliability, a dimension in the objectivity domain, afect the credibility of an agency and its data products. 2. Competing data sources and methods.

Interference in the publication of statistics, or even the appearance of such interference, can have profound repercussions for the credibility of a data provider and its actions. For example, when the technical report of the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index (the “Boskin Commission”) identifed a potential upward bias in the Consumer Price Index in 1995, it included estimated impacts of this bias on the federal bud­ get defcit. Tese implications were seized upon by the press and by political interest groups as suggesting possible political motives for the Commission’s technical analysis (see, e.g., Gordon 2000), reducing the credibility of both the Commission and the Consumer Price Index. Polit­ ical interference is also a threat to scientifc integrity, a dimension of the integrity domain, and it relates to the perceptions of users, a threat to relevance in the utility domain. 5. Obsolescence. For agencies to remain credible with those who use the data and information, the best available scientifc and statistical methods must be used to obtain data and produce data products. If these methods do not evolve, over time processes that once led to credible data and information become dated and diminish the credibility of the agency and its data prod­ ucts."

Computer and physical security of data refers to the protection of information throughout the col­ lection, production, analysis, and development process from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsifcation. Tis defnition is based on prior OMB guidance (OMB 2006, 2002) and the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000). OMB guidance identifes several related best practices for survey data that can be applied to nonsurvey and nonstatistical data (OMB 2006): • Establishing procedures and mechanisms to protect confdential information throughout the production and development process (Guideline 3.4.1, 19) • Ensuring that data systems and electronic products are protected from unauthorized access storage systems that include confdential information, which are protected from unauthorized access (Guideline 3.4.2.2, 19) Computer and physical security"

Te National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Implementation Project2 which provides the overarching framework all federal agencies need to follow. Some primary references are NIST SP 800-37r23 and NIST SP 800-53r54 that provide additional detail critical for this topic area. Treats to Computer and Physical Security 1. Supply chain risk.

Bad actors may try to sneak malicious devices on the hardware during production, modifed post produc­ tion while in transit, at the data center, or while in use. To follow U.S. laws and regulations, some equipment cannot be obtained when manufactured in certain countries or points of origin. Te 2020 Covid-19 pandemic also exposed the weakness in availability of parts that can create service disruptions/outages when parts need replacement. 2. Human error. Human errors are those that are accidental disclosures or disruptions that are not intentional or willful, malicious acts. Malicious acts may depend on human error such as clicking on links or opening email attachments. Disclosure due to accidental loss of phys­ ical devices (i.e. smart phone, laptop, hardware tokens, etc.) can lead to attack. Other errors include not following policy, training, or other required rules that require compliance."

For IT systems, misconfguration or failure to apply required protections to IT assets can lead to data breeches and other disruptive attacks. 3. Insider Treat. Attempts by employees or trusted individuals to gain unauthorized access to systems and data are insider threats. Acts include, but are not limited to, exfltration or thef of sensitive data and/or equipment, destruction of property, denial of service, and installation of unauthorized sofware that performs malicious or illegal acts. 4. External Treats. External actors seeking to gain illegal access, disrupt, or destroy IT systems and data through a variety of threats and tactics are external threats. Common examples of external threats include phishing, malicious hacking, denial of service attacks, logic bombs, and ransomware.

Individually-identifable data are data that permit the identity of the respondent or entity to which the information apply to be reason­ ably inferred by either direct or indirect means. A growing literature has acknowledged and formalized the fact that each data product published from a given dataset will incur some ex­ penditure of the underlying dataset’s “privacy budget” (see, e.g., Abowd and Schmutte 2019). Treats to confdentiality increase with the level of detail provided by the data, including the granularity of the data and the number of data elements included in microdata fles. Rare or unusual population characteristics or phenomena included in a data product can also increase threats to confdentiality. Methods for avoiding disclosure of confdential data and the in­ teraction of those methods with granularity and other data quality elements are described under utility.

Treats to Confdentiality 1. Granularity. Disclosure risks increase with granularity. Data products, including data fles and outputs that provide information for small population groups, small population geographic units, and narrow time intervals increase disclosure risks.

Tis threat is increased when the fle or output includes rare or unlikely combinations defned by multiple elements and for linked data products which increase the data elements associated with individual units. To mitigate this threat data products undergo rigorous process to evaluate disclosure risk prior to release and various methods of disclosure reduction are applied to the fles that are released. Tese mitigations can impact the utility of the fles. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 45 References Abowd JM, Schmutte IM. 2019.

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,52,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 48 4 Best Practices for Identifying and Reporting Data Quality The Importance of Reporting Data Quality Te ICSP has stated that “agencies should work to adopt a common language and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and derivative information they disseminate” (ICSP 2018). Te framework described in this report is designed to fll that need. Te framework establishes core concepts grounded in the prevailing literature and international experiences, which can be fexibly applied to accommodate agencies’ needs and priorities. Data and analyses can provide powerful insight and understanding for decision makers, but they can just as easily misguide decision makers. To serve the rapidly evolving world of data-driven decision-making, data producers and analysts must iden­ tify and report the quality of the data they produce so that the data products can be used efectively. No data are perfect. Te increasing use of integrated data and nonstatistical data for statistical purposes sometimes com­ pounds and sometimes ameliorates those imperfections. Ideal approaches for identifying and reporting data quality nec­ essarily difer among data products and the complexity of these activities is higher for complicated data products, such as integrated data."

Ideal approaches for identifying and reporting data quality nec­ essarily difer among data products and the complexity of these activities is higher for complicated data products, such as integrated data. For integrated data in particular, ICSP (2018) emphasizes the need to provide data users with contextual information about source data, the impact of disclosure limitation treatments, integration methods, when applicable, and the assumptions, defaults and uncertainties that underlie the methods used to convert source and integrated data into data products. Te framework encompasses a broad concept of data quality that spans many dimensions, allowing data producers and analysts, data users and other stakeholders to think holistically about the strengths and weaknesses of data products and assess trade-ofs among the dimensions when making decisions. As shown in the discussion of data quality considerations in Chapter 3 and described in Appendix B (Accuracy and Reliability of Integrated Data), the framework can be used to identify threats and manage trade-ofs among them. Te framework was developed for statistical data, data designed and collected for statistical purposes (i.e. surveys and cen­ suses), and nonstatistical data. Nonstatistical data, data originally collected for administrative or other purposes, are increas­ ingly acquired for secondary use and include administrative records, data from satellites, sensors and other monitors, and web scraping. Te framework can also be used for integrated data, which are produced using statistical data, nonstatistical data or both. Te framework can be used to assess data quality threats for all types of data products. Tese data products include data col­ lections and data fles as well as the statistical information produced from them, such as tables, graphics and estimates."

Te framework can be used to evaluate data produced through integration, modeling, harmonization and other analyses where identifying threats to each dimension of data quality in the framework can be done for all steps of the production process. Integrated data products, for example, include the quality threats for each input source and those resulting from integration methods (Zhang 2012). Additional quality threats can result from the analytic methods used to produce data outputs. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 49 Reporting data quality is necessarily nested, from comprehensive internal documentation for current and future data stewards and program managers to the most relevant extracts of that documentation for diferent external uses and users. Comprehensive and accessible documentation maintained by data producers is the foundation for the data quality information provided for users.

Te implementation of best practices includes as­ sessment and documentation of the primary threats to data quality in each of its dimensions, including efects of mitigations and trade-ofs among them. Identifying Treats to Data Quality Te framework can be used to regularly and systematically consider potential threats to the utility, objectivity and integrity of the data, and their associated dimensions. In addition, uncertainties about the ability to anticipate threats, as well as actions taken to detect and address threats, can be assessed and identifed. Even though some identifed threats may not warrant special scrutiny or inclusion in a data product’s documentation, assessing all dimensions is still important. Furthermore, using the framework to systematically identify threats to data quality facilitates the management of trade-ofs among them and their mitigations for decision making. Best practices for identifying threats to data quality include: • Consider threats to data quality when developing a new data collection or data product, including threats from new sources and methods.

Reporting for a particular data output will build from the detailed doc­ umentation for the data collection from which it is derived and will include the documentation of additional quality assessments for any integration methods and statistical methods used in its production. Best practices for reporting data quality include: 1 Create detailed technical documentation about all aspects of the data program product to meet the programmatic needs for product continuity and dissemination. Documentation should de­ scribe the main features of the data product, including its purpose, principal uses, population and sub-population coverage, the time frames for which it is available, and the expected periodicity of its production. It should include technical operations and production details, methods used in processing, including imputations and weighting, editing, integration methods and evaluations, and data dictionaries. In addition, any changes made to data fles to ensure confdentiality and any impacts on inference should be described. For ongoing data products, changes to key constructs, methods, outputs, and their impacts on data quality should be described. 2 Summarize the quality of the data product in its internal documentation, including identifed threats, management of trade-ofs among them, and any mitigation measures employed.

By reporting data quality for a broad set of dimensions, the internal documentation can be used to tailor additional user reports for users on data products and outputs with the most relevant and valued data quality information. 3 Consider the quality of each input data source and all processing steps when documenting integrat­ ed data. Documentation should include the methods used for additional processing of source data needed for integration, including imputations and editing, if needed, and relevant methodological information about integration methods. It should include detailed evaluations of identifed threats to the integrated quality of the data, particularly threats most relevant for the integrated data. Be­ cause the intended use of an integrated data product may difer from the original purposes associ­ ated with the input data, data quality for each input source should be documented for its use in the integrated data product.

Tis report summarizes the state of practice in identifying and reporting data quality issues consistent with a framework established in the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) and described best practices put forth by FCSM for identifying and reporting quality threats.

In addition, several approaches and methods have been identifed that have yet to be adopted within most, if not all, federal statistical agencies, or that require additional research before they can be used extensively, including: 1 Methods for evaluating the quality of ofcial statistics based on integrated data. For ofcial statistics derived directly from surveys, metrics for assessing data quality based on the sources of error are well established (e.g. FCSM 2001). For ofcial statistics produced using integrated data, the quality depends on the quality of the primary sources and how they are combined. For ofcial statistics de­ veloped from integrated data, new measures of data quality are needed (Agafţei et al. 2015, Keller et al. 2017). Metrics capturing the added value, if any, from integrated data compared to survey data could be insightful and guide future eforts; 2 Identifying determinants of response and measurement error in administrative data and other nonsur­ vey data. Researchers have developed a deep knowledge base about how and why survey respondents provide accurate responses, enabling surveys to be designed to elicit the best information (Groves et al. 2009). As agencies rely more and more on administrative data and other nonsurvey data to cre­ ate statistical outputs, a similar set of research applied to these nonsurvey collections is likely to be valuable. As an example, North American Industry Classifcation System (NAICS) codes comprise a business classifcation based on industry production processes. NAICS codes are self-reported on tax forms and due to their complexity may be subject to considerable error5."

NAICS codes are self-reported on tax forms and due to their complexity may be subject to considerable error5. Te Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income (SOI) uses an intensive manual validation process for their published statistical data. Statistical models developed using SOI data can be used to improve NAICS codes on individual, corporate and partnership returns that are missing or incorrect; 3 Methods for assessing coverage errors when data are not sampled according to a pre-determined de­ sign. Te challenges of measuring the coverage of sampling frames and adjusting for undercoverage (or overcoverage) have been well studied (Groves, 1989). When adopting methods for integrated data using administrative data, the data may represent a nonprobability sample; other data may be intended to be complete for a specifc population, but are not. New or enhanced approaches to measuring and adjusting for coverage that can be adopted in both research and production envi­ ronments would be valuable. As an example, linking data to a disease registry may lack coverage if certain states are not represented in the registry; 5. Te estimated error rates for administrative data for 2007–2016 were approximately 20 percent for Forms 1040 Schedule C (Proft or Loss from Business)."

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 53 4 Methods for assessing the interaction between diferent types of errors. For example, how do miss­ ingness and linkage errors interact? How do harmonization errors and coverage errors interact? What are the tradeofs between timeliness and model error assessment? Sensitivity analyses are a valuable tool in this process. Yet, at the present time, these analyses generally evaluate the efect of one error at a time and a representative truth source to be used as comparison is rarely available (Harron et al. 2017). Developing designs and subsequent analyses for sensitivity studies that allow these more complex interactions to be evaluated is important (Saltelli et al. 2006). Increasing use of ensemble methods in data analytics can introduce hidden errors as outputs from initial models, which are subject to estimation error, are integrated into blended data and used as inputs into other analytical methods (Singh, et al. 2020); 5 For integrated data, methods to quantify uncertainty of the outputs given the errors across all input sources, including errors from the integration steps and the fnal analyses leading to the outputs."

Te total survey error paradigm provides a framework for quantifying the uncertainty of survey-based estimators. When reporting uncertainty of these statistics, the measure of error accounts for sam­ pling error and some nonsurvey errors such as nonresponse and undercoverage but not for other nonsampling errors such as linkage error (Groves and Lyberg 2010). Te challenge of accurately re­ fecting uncertainty is even greater for integrated data and may require new methods (Pferfermann 2015). Developing guidelines and/or methods that allow an agency to determine the best approach for a particular application would be helpful; 6 Methods for disclosure risk protection and documentation of disclosure risk protection. A variety of statistical disclosure methods have been used within agencies, including data swapping, coars­ ening, noise infusion, and synthetic data. With the increase use of integrated data, the these are being re-evaluated. Diferential privacy, which focuses on quantifying the risk of disclosure, utilizes a metric for controlling that risk. Te Census Bureau is developing algorithms for the 2020 Census that will allow them to adopt a diferential privacy approach (Abowd 2018, Dwork 2019)."

Other approaches to statistical disclosure limitation, such as online table builders, are also being developed (Shlomo et al. 2019). Tere is a growing recognition of the importance of controlling disclosure risks using diferential disclosure methods, especially as more data become publicly available. Many agencies would beneft by having approaches identifed for assessing what method should be adopt­ ed and for adapting the selected method to a particular application; 7 Best practices for communicating quality across various audiences with new sources of data. A ma­ jor trend in ofcial statistics is the increased use of graphics and interactive dissemination tools. Sometimes the quality of the statistics become less evident in the process. However, research is pro­ viding insights into how to communicate uncertainty graphically (Potter et al. 2012). Guidelines for best practices would be useful; and"

As an example, using administrative data for analytics of­ ten requires an understanding of the business processes behind the data (Singh, et al. 2020). Some appropriate metrics for assessing the quality dimension of accuracy and reliability within the objec­ tivity domain are well established. Identifying the best metrics for all of the dimensions is a crucial step toward being able to establish templates and tools that can easily lead to data quality reports and data quality components of standard metadata when analyses are based on integrated data. Te history of work to evaluate data quality includes many successes and a few ideas (such as data quality profles) that have not completely fulflled their promise. Future evolution will be rapid and positive if data producers embrace a culture of continuous improvement and channel their experiences, both successful and less successful, into a learning agenda as recommended by the Commission of Evidence-Based Policymaking (2017) and reinforced by the Foundations for Evi- dence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Pub.

State-of-the-art methods for measuring and reporting data quality will advance if data producers and analysts cultivate opportunities to collaborate and share their experiences to advance our eforts to promote data quality and transparency in reporting for federal data.

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,63,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 59 A.3 Statutory and Policy Requirements (2001-2006) Te Information Quality Act, issued as Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515(a), 2000) directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines that “provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of informa­ tion (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.” Acknowledging the wide range of potential applica­ tions of these principles to specifc circumstances, the Act stipulated that OMB guidance should require each applicable agency to issue its own implementation guidelines. OMB issued guidelines in 2002 to implement the Act (OMB 2002a, 2002b). In the OMB guidance, information quality is described as an overarching concept that includes Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of information. Objectivity refers to presenting accurate, reliable, and unbiased information in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner. Utility refers to the usefulness of the information to the intended users. Integrity refers to providing the data security required to protect information from unauthorized access or revision through corruption or falsifcation (OMB 2002a)."

Integrity refers to providing the data security required to protect information from unauthorized access or revision through corruption or falsifcation (OMB 2002a). During 2002, OMB issued several additional policies that revised, clarifed, and expanded its initial guidance. Te June 4, 2002 OMB guidance, (OMB 2002b) provided cites to each statistical organization’s draf guidelines and described some basic features of how the Nation’s principal statistical organizations would be responsive to the OMB guidelines. Tese guidelines were intended to be included as part of the responses from the Departments and agencies in which the statistical organizations are located. Departments and agencies were required to issue their own implementing guidelines. Features included a commitment to quality and professional standards of practice, such as: • Using modern statistical theory and practice in all technical work; • Developing strong staf expertise in the disciplines relevant to its mission; • Implementing ongoing quality assurance programs to improve data validity and reliability and to improve the processes of compiling, editing, and analyzing data; and • Developing a strong and continuing relationship with appropriate professional organizations in the felds of statistics and relevant subject-matter areas. Te guidance called for applying high standards of performance to the following activities: • Development of concepts and methods; • Planning and design of surveys and other means of collecting data; • Collection of data; • Processing and editing of data; • Analysis of data; • Production of estimates or projections; • Establishment of review procedures; and • Dissemination of data by published reports, electronic fles and other media requested by users."

FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 60 An FCSM Committee used this list of activities as a backbone on which to build a set of standards and guidelines for sta­ tistical surveys. Basing their work in large part on FCSM Working Paper 31, described above, the Committee proposed the set of standards that were approved by FCSM and then adopted by OMB and issued in 2006 as Statistical Policy Directive 2 (OMB 2006). A.4 Increasing Use of Nonstatistical and Integrated Data for Statistical Purposes (2011-2016) Several OMB policy memoranda in the last decade provided support and led to the use of nontraditional sources and integration of nontraditional and traditional data sources to produce new federal statistical information products. Some examples include: • OMB M-11-02, “Sharing Data While Protecting Privacy,” (OMB 2011) directs “agencies to fnd solutions that allow data sharing to move forward in a manner that complies with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and polices.” Tis includes “seeking ways to facilitate responsible data sharing for the purpose of conducting rigorous studies that promote informed public policy decisions.” • OMB M-13-13, “Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset,” (OMB 2013) was issued “to help institutionalize the principles of efective information management at each stage of the information’s life cycle to promote interoperability and openness.” • OMB M-14-06, “Guidance for Providing and Using Administrative Data for Statistical Purposes,” (OMB 2014) “encourages Federal departments and agencies to promote the use of administrative data for statistical purposes and provides guidance in addressing legal and policy requirements for such uses, including the need to continue to fully protect the privacy and Confdentiality aforded to the individuals, businesses, and institutions providing the data.” • OMB M-15-15, “Improving Statistical Activities through Interagency Collaboration,” (OMB 2015) “strongly encourages the Federal statistical agencies and units, and their parent Departments, to build interagency collaboration that will help the Federal statistical community more efectively meet the information needs of the 21st century.”"

In particular, these revisions clarifed agencies’ information security responsibilities to align with the open data policy outlined in OMB M-13-13. A.5 Plotting a Course for Federal Statistics (2015-2017) In 2015, the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) established a panel on Improving Federal Statistics for Policy and Social Science Research Using Multiple Data Sources and State-of-the-Art Estimation “to conduct a study to foster a paradigm shif in federal statistical programs that would use combinations of diverse data sources from government and private-sector sources in place of a single census, survey, or administrative records source.” Tis CNSTAT panel released two reports in 2017. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 61 In its frst report, Innovations in Federal Statistics: Combining Data Sources While Protecting Privacy, the CNSTAT panel acknowledged the increasing eforts over the previous decade to incorporate an ever-widening range of data sources into federal statistics, while noting that much work is still needed to achieve an efective shif from the single-survey paradigm to a multiple-source paradigm (CNSTAT 2017). Much of the report is dedicated to describing the range of potential sources that are and could be exploited to increase the quality and/or cost-efciency of federal statistics, and/or to reduce response burden on the public."

Much of the report is dedicated to describing the range of potential sources that are and could be exploited to increase the quality and/or cost-efciency of federal statistics, and/or to reduce response burden on the public. Te frst two recommendations are for federal statistical agencies to undertake systematic reviews of their existing statistical portfolios to evaluate the potential benefts and risks of using administrative and private sector data sources. To support these reviews, and to enable transparency with data users, the report advocates for the development of a data quality framework that contextualizes the strengths and weaknesses of diferent sources and approaches to their incorpo­ ration. It envisions a systemwide efort, in collaboration with academia and industry, to develop this framework and use it to create standards for evaluating integrated data product’s ftness for various uses. Te CNSTAT panel’s second report, Federal Statistics, Multiple Data Sources, and Privacy Protection: Next Steps, expands on the frst report’s call for the systematic assessment of data quality, examining existing quality measurement approaches and identifying some desired features of an updated quality framework (CNSTAT 2018). It reviews the well-developed Total Survey Error framework that is usually applied to one data collection at a time, noting that agencies have built up careful protocols around this framework for understanding and reporting data quality. Te panel recommends that federal statistical agencies adopt a broader data quality framework for statistical information that captures multiple dimensions of data quality, not just the accuracy dimension on which the Total Survey Error framework focuses. In particular, it identifes timeliness and granularity as two important dimensions to include."

In particular, it identifes timeliness and granularity as two important dimensions to include. At the same time, the panel notes the need for each di­ mension to be deep enough to include pertinent aspects of nonstatistical and integrated data as well as survey data. Te pan­ el also notes the need to include well-developed treatments of data linkage errors and their potential efects on the resulting statistics. Recommendation 6-2 (p. 127) states that a useful framework for using alternative data sources “. . . should outline and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative data sources on the basis of a comprehensive quality framework and, if possible, quantify the quality attributes and make them transparent to users.” Te panel states further that “Agencies should focus more attention on the tradeofs between diferent quality aspects, such as trading precision for Timeliness and Granularity, rather than focusing primarily on Accuracy” (CNSTAT 2018). During 2016 and 2017, a separate efort to envision a new paradigm in federal statistics was also underway. Te Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking was established by the U.S. Congress (Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2016 (Pub. L. No. 114-140)) and charged with developing a strategy to increase the availability and use of data to build evi­ dence about government programs, while protecting privacy and confdentiality."

Like the CNSTAT panel, the Commission focused substantial attention on the potential use of administrative data. Some of its 22 recommendations can be applied towards improving the federal statistical agencies’ access to such data, while safeguarding the privacy of individuals and or­ ganizations that provide it. But the Commission also encouraged improved curation of data as it is being collected, with the maintenance of metadata to enable potential secondary users to assess and report on its ftness-for-use. Te Commission’s fnal report “envisions a future in which rigorous evidence is created efciently, as a routine part of government operations, and used to construct efective public policy.” Troughout the report, the Commission emphasizes the importance of producing high quality data to enable evidence that supports policymaking (Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking 2017).

On December 21, 2018 the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 was enrolled and on January 14, 2019, the Evidence Act was signed into law (Pub. L. No. 115-435, 132 Stat. 5529, 2018). Te Evidence Act addressed 11 of the Commission’s 22 recommendations and called for an Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to continue the conversation on others. It articu­ lated a presumption that data assets held by federal agencies will be made accessible to statistical agencies and units, while requiring those statistical agencies to expand the access they provide to data for evidence building. To advance data quality, it required federal agencies to designate Statistical Ofcials to advise the Department on statistical policy, techniques, and procedures. In memorandum M-19-23, OMB elaborated the responsibilities of the Statistical Ofcials to include serving as the “agency champion for data quality to ensure data Relevance (e.g., by validating that data are appropriate, accurate, objective, accessible, useful, understandable, and timely), harness existing data (e.g., by identifying data needs and reusing data if possible), anticipate future uses (e.g., by building interoperability of data from its inception), and demonstrate responsiveness (e.g., by improving data collection, analysis, and dissemination with ongoing input from users and stake­ holders)” (OMB 2019c, 30)."

Te Evidence Act also contains several provisions aimed at improving the quality of federal data assets, by requiring agencies to “develop and maintain a strategic information resources management plan that. . . im­ plements a process to evaluate and improve the timeliness, completeness, consistency, accuracy, usefulness, and availability of open Government data assets” (Pub. L. No. 115-435, Title II, Sec. 202(c), 2018, 4174-8). Meanwhile, the executive branch has also taken its own actions to promote the expanded use of existing federal data assets for evidence building. Te President’s Management Agenda “Modernizing Government for the 21st Century,” launched in March of 2018, identifed “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset” as a Cross-Agency Priority Goal. To pursue this goal, OMB developed the Federal Data Strategy; among the 10 governing principles it announced in June 2019 is “Ensure Relevance: Protect the quality and Integrity of the data. Validate that data are appropriate, accurate, objective, accessible, useful, under­ standable, and timely” (OMB 2019b). Tis principle is aligned with the Statistical Ofcial’s responsibility identifed above."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,66,"Validate that data are appropriate, accurate, objective, accessible, useful, under­ standable, and timely” (OMB 2019b). Tis principle is aligned with the Statistical Ofcial’s responsibility identifed above. One of the 20 Action Items in the 2020 Action Plan is to “Develop Data Quality Measuring and Reporting Guidance” (which this report will, in part, fulfll). New OMB guidance on the Information Quality Act also speaks to the emerging use of multiple data sources. In April 2019, OMB released memorandum M-19-15, “Guidance on Improving Implementation of the Information Quality Act.” Tis up­ dated guidance acknowledges that the CNSTAT recommended the use of a comprehensive quality framework that includes evaluating and documenting the timeliness, relevance, accuracy, accessibility, coherence, integrity, privacy and confdentiality, transparency and interpretability, and granularity of each data source that is used to increase the integrity of analyses based on administrative data and data combined across two or more sources. OMB M-19-15 notes that Te Foundations for Evi- dence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 codifes these concepts as agency responsibilities. Because of the growing secondary use of data for purposes other than the reason the data were originally collected, OMB M-19-15 calls for the development of procedures for documenting and disseminating information on the quality of administrative data that have the potential to be used for statistical purposes, emphasizing the fact that the documentation should be sufcient to allow data users to determine the ftness-for-purpose of the data for use in secondary analysis (OMB 2019a).

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,67,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 63 A.7 ICSP and FCSM Products (2017–present) In 2017, the FCSM established a Working Group on Transparent Quality Reporting in the Integration of Multiple Data Sources to support the identifcation of best practices around data quality measurement and reporting for integrated data products. Te Working Group and the Washington Statistical Society co-sponsored several public workshops to gather in­ formation. Te frst three workshops focused on the quality of input data, data processing, and statistical outputs; additional workshops focused on the quality of geospatial data, transparent reporting of meta-data, and sensitivity analyses followed. Tey provided examples of the variety of ways agencies have integrated new data sources into their statistical programs, creating a variety of potential benefts such as cost savings and efciency in production, increased timeliness and granular­ ity, and reductions in measurement error. More information about the frst three workshops can be found in JPSM report, Findings fom the Integrated Data Workshops Hosted by the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology and W ashington Statistical Society (Brown et al. 2018) sponsored by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Tese potential benefts are weighed against the many challenges that are faced when using nonstatistical sources and in­ tegrating multiple sources. From an input perspective, assessing the quality of alternative data sources is similar in many dimensions to assessing traditional survey data concerns over coverage and representativeness, coherence and consistency over time, reporting errors, and missingness can be mapped to traditional survey error concepts relatively straightforwardly. Tere are fewer parallels for less structured and unstructured data sources, where development of ontologies and models is necessary to use the data in statistical estimation."

Tere are fewer parallels for less structured and unstructured data sources, where development of ontologies and models is necessary to use the data in statistical estimation. With many kinds of external data sources, the statistical agency has less control over and less information about the data than in the traditional survey context; transparency around the original purpose of collecting the data was emphasized. Te various processes employed in the integration of data sources (e.g., record linkage, data fusion, and systems for har­ monizing variables introduce additional data quality challenges. Te workshops highlighted the importance of providing transparency to data users about the techniques used to integrate sources, the assumptions that underlie them, and the biases these might create in resulting integrated estimates and data products. Approaches for measuring the quality of integrated sources tend to vary based on the available tools. For example, a high quality “truth deck” can be extremely useful for deter­ mining the quality of a linked data product. When no verifcation data are available, sensitivity analysis can provide valuable information about the importance of modeling assumptions on the statistical output. New methods for sensitivity analysis continue to be developed and may be able to be adapted by statistical agencies. To complement the information from the workshops, the SOI Division of the Internal Revenue Service sponsored a report by Mathematica Policy Research that examined data quality frameworks and standards used outside the United States by national statistical ofces and international organizations, including the European Statistical System and a selection of in­ dividual European countries, Canada, Australia, the OECD, and the IMF."

As in the workshops, the literature across these countries and organizations is nearly uniform in defning data quality as “ftness-for-use” in which “good” or “high” quality data meets its intended purpose in operations, decision-making, and planning. In addition, data quality is expressed in each of these quality frameworks as multi-dimensional, with recognized trade-ofs among the dimensions and with the accuracy dimension ofen given the most attention. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 64 Te ICSP has established a set of principles on which to base the development of a data quality framework and standards for agencies in the United States. Tey note that: All data have potential errors, and errors can be compounded when data from diferent sources are integrated to produce statistical estimates. Poorly estimated or overextended statistics can misguide decision makers, leading to costly consequences. Federal statistical agencies must ensure that nonstatistical or integrated data sources result in quality statistics and clearly, meaningfully, and efectively communicate the limitations of those statistics, so they are used wisely (ICSP 2018)."

Te ICSP principles place a high priority on using the best quality source data, while recognizing the value of granularity and timeliness as aspects of that quality. Tey emphasize the importance of reporting transparently to data users on the strengths and limitations of disseminated data, including the assumptions and uncertainties that may underlie them, in a way that is relevant to the expected applications of the data. Finally, they state that: Agencies should work to adopt common language and framework for reporting on the quality of data sets and derivative information they disseminate. Te focus should be on providing information that will meet user needs, which may vary by product and agency. Drawing on industry standards, where they exist, will improve interopera­ bility of federal and nonfederal data (ICSP 2018).

Accuracy and Reliability of Integrated Data B.1 Overview Te accuracy and reliability of data are frequently the focus of data quality evaluations. Tis topic deserves a more robust discussion for interested readers, especially considering the importance of accuracy and reliability when data are released as ofcial statistics or used as infuential inputs to policies and decisions (OMB 2019). Many factors that afect accuracy and reliability and their efects have been well-described as error sources for surveys in the Total Survey Error (TSE) paradigm (see, e.g., Groves 1989, FCSM 2001). However, there are additional threats unique to the accuracy and reliability of inte­ grated data, including linkage error and modeling error. More generally, threats to accuracy and reliability for integrated data include threats of the input data sources, the processing steps, and the resulting data outputs. Approaches beyond those used for survey data will be needed to examine and convey uncertainties as new types of integrated data products and out­ puts are developed."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,71,"More generally, threats to accuracy and reliability for integrated data include threats of the input data sources, the processing steps, and the resulting data outputs. Approaches beyond those used for survey data will be needed to examine and convey uncertainties as new types of integrated data products and out­ puts are developed. Given the variety of statistical and nonstatistical data sources, integration methods and data products, the best approaches for measuring and reporting error for integrated data will depend on the data product under evaluation. Potential approach­ es include: a) direct comparisons to an external gold standard; b) benchmarking with known subject-specifc and other relevant information; and c) conducting sensitivity analyses, such as evaluations of critical processing and analysis decisions, generally applied to modeling assumptions used in an analysis (Goldsmith 2005). Established high-quality national statis­ tical data for use as gold standard data and benchmarking will continue to be critical for assessing the quality of new data products. B.2 Precise and Unbiased Information In sample surveys, accuracy can be formally described as the closeness of a sample-based statistic, such as a sample mean () (or sample median, proportion) to its population-level counterpart, such as a population mean (μ). Groves et al. (2009) divides the errors encountered in sample surveys into two categories: errors of measurement, which afect the accuracy of any single observation and errors of representation, which refer to factors that diminish how well a sample of units “repre­ sent”—portray, capture, or measure—the characteristics, conditions, experiences or behaviors of the population. Whereas these concepts are traditionally presented in the context of sample surveys, they apply broadly to all data that are used to measure or refect a characteristic of some population of interest. Indeed, Zhang (2012) extends the concepts to administra­ tive and integrated data. Te efects of such errors may be usefully divided into two, broad subcomponents: a systematic component in which the measured data deviates from the true values in a nonrandom way and a nonsystematic component which introduces random variation in any set of estimates."

Te efects of such errors may be usefully divided into two, broad subcomponents: a systematic component in which the measured data deviates from the true values in a nonrandom way and a nonsystematic component which introduces random variation in any set of estimates. Tese components of error map into two components of accuracy: statistical unbiasedness and statistical precision. Statistical unbiasedness refers to a condition where “the expected value of an estimate of a characteristic is equal to the true population value” (CNSTAT 2018, 40). Te phrase “expected value of an estimate” refers to a value that would emerge if the population were sampled and re-sampled many times, the estimate calculated for each sample, and an average (expected value) of all sample estimates calculated from all the possible samples. A broader concept of unbiasedness is also found in the dimension scientifc integrity, within the data quality framework’s integrity domain (OMB 2008, OMB 2014, ICSP 2018). FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 68 Statistical precision, defned as the inverse of the variance, indicates the variability of an estimate. Statistical precision is related to the errors, or threats, that afect variance and standard errors, including sampling error and modeling error. Te ICSP defnes statistical precision as “a measure of how close two or more measurements of the same statistic are to each other” (ICSP 2018)."

Te ICSP defnes statistical precision as “a measure of how close two or more measurements of the same statistic are to each other” (ICSP 2018). Estimates with high statistical precision have lower variance and are more accurate than those with low statistical precision. Like unbiasedness, precision has constructs in other disciplines that difer from its statistical use here. For example, numerical precision is the number of digits in a number; precision can also indicate, resolution (or granularity), the smallest interval measurable by the scientifc instrument (i.e., our data collections). B.3 Threats to Precision and Sources of Bias Tis section describes the various kinds of error that can harm the precision of estimates and create bias. It includes threats that afect statistical surveys like measurement, sampling, nonresponse, coverage, and processing errors, as well as threats unique to integrated data like linkage, harmonization, and modeling errors. We also discuss some additional threats specifc to geographic data. Measurement error: In the framework of TSE, the accuracy of a survey statistic can be afected by two sets of errors, which are classifed as errors of representation and errors of measurement in the context of a survey life cycle (Groves et al. 2009, 48)."

Tere are two defnitions of measurement error. According to one defnition, measurement error is defned as the “dif­ ference between the observed value of a variable and the true, but unobserved, value of that variable” (FCSM 2001, 1-6). Alternatively, the term “measurement error” may refer to the variance (or standard deviation) of that diference. In a survey, measurement error typically occurs when a respondent provides inaccurate information, for example, if the respondent mis­ understands the survey question or if they have poor recall of the items they are being asked about. Frequently measurement error is conceived as adding to the variability (imprecision) of an estimate rather than contributing to a biased estimate, which is a scenario in which the variance (or standard deviation) of the error can serve well as a mea­ sure. However, the literature on TSE conceived of measurement error broadly and allows for such error to afect either the variance or the bias of an estimate (Groves, 1989, 17). In the context of survey data, measurement error comes from four pri­ mary sources in survey data collection: the questionnaire, the data collection method, the interviewer and the respondent.” (FCSM 2001, 1-6)."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,72,"In the context of survey data, measurement error comes from four pri­ mary sources in survey data collection: the questionnaire, the data collection method, the interviewer and the respondent.” (FCSM 2001, 1-6). Examples of mode efects include diferences among in-person face-to-face interviews, telephone inter­ views, and web surveys; within web surveys, there is also the possibility of mode diferences in how respondents respond to an interview administered on a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet, or on a handheld phone. Te questionnaire or survey script can contribute to measurement error if the information requested is not clear to respondents, or if the skip patterns are unclear. Finally, the respondent can add to measurement error by reporting incorrect responses—either because the respondent does not want to reveal a sensitive piece of information or attempts to give socially desirable answers rather than the correct answer. For a given data collection, agencies may report on various aspects of measurement error in diferent publications. Although ideal, there may not be a single, comprehensive publication by an agency that collates all the work the agency and others have done to study the data collection’s measurement error, particularly if data collections and assessments are ongoing. However, it could be helpful for an agency publication that contains its estimates to include: (a) a brief description of measurement error and its possible efects, and (b) citations to studies that the agency (or others) have conducted on measurement error that are pertinent for the data collection at hand.

FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,73,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 69 Agencies employ a variety of approaches to identify and address possible sources of measurement error before an instrument goes into the feld. For example, an agency may test the data collection instrument using cognitive interviewing to identify possible interpretations of questions and evaluate question-response patterns (e.g., NCHS 2020), which allows the instru­ ment to be revised and perhaps re-tested before implementation. Similar factors can contribute to measurement error in nonsurvey data. For secondary uses of nonstatistical data, the mea­ surement error can difer among its original purpose and its intended uses. Further, the importance of measurement error and the eforts to reduce it may difer between its original purpose and its intended uses. Importantly, for data originally collected for administrative or other purposes, the primary documentation necessary for detecting and remedying these errors may not be available. Sampling Error: Sampling error has long been associated with survey data and the probability-based surveys that generate them. Obtaining data for an entire population is expensive, if even possible."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,73,"Sampling error has long been associated with survey data and the probability-based surveys that generate them. Obtaining data for an entire population is expensive, if even possible. However, a consequence of using survey-based data is that samples have sampling error attached to them. Treats to accuracy for integrated data that combine surveys or combine surveys with other types of data will include the sampling error of the respective surveys. Perhaps the most common defnition for sampling error is that such error is the diference between a sample-based statistic and the (unknown) population value. For example, when using the sample mean Χ as an estimate for the population mean μ, we can represent the sampling error as the diference ε = Χ – μ. By this defnition, if the sample is not a subset but the full set of the population—if the sample is tantamount to a census—then the population value would be known (apart from other, nonsampling errors, described below) and there is no sampling error. Tis symbolic defnition ε = Χ – μ is captured in the textual defnition in Statistical Directive 2 which states that “Sampling error is the error associated with nonobservation, that is, the error that occurs because all members of the frame population are not measured” (OMB 2006, 34). A second defnition of sampling error builds upon the frst defnition. Using the frst defnition, sampling error per se cannot be measured; that is, ε = Χ – μ cannot be measured because that calculation would require knowledge of the (unknown) population parameter μ."

Using the frst defnition, sampling error per se cannot be measured; that is, ε = Χ – μ cannot be measured because that calculation would require knowledge of the (unknown) population parameter μ. However, statistical procedures are available to measure the variability of sampling error in two ways—the variance of sampling error V(ε) and the standard error of sampling error SE(ε), where the latter is the square root of the former. Te term sampling error sometimes refers to the variability of sampling error, usually measured by SE(ε). Tis second meaning for sampling error is captured in an FCSM working paper, which states: “Sampling error refers to the vari­ ability that occurs by chance because a sample rather than an entire population was surveyed” (FCSM 2001, 1-5, emphasis added). Tus, by one defnition sampling error is ε and by another it is SE(ε). Context usually indicates which meaning is intended. In fact, discussion of the many types of errors—not just sampling error—ofen (implicitly) involves the variability of the error rather than the error itself. Te term standard error may refer to the standard error for a sample-based estimate, such as the standard error of a sample mean, SE(Χ) and the phrase standard error of the sampling error, as measured by SE(ε), may not even appear. However, the two standard errors are equivalent."

Tus, although sampling error and its variability may seem re­ moved for common statistical practice, these concepts tie directly with how much variability there is in the estimates that users of the statistics care about directly: the sample-based statistics for means, totals, proportions and other statistical quantities. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 70 Due to the random sampling methodologies that well-designed probability-based surveys employ, sampling error is unbi­ ased. Even though individual samples may difer from the overall population, because the process is unbiased, diferences are not consistent or directional. Instead sampling error threatens statistical analysis by reducing precision. Specifcally, a large sampling error and large SE(ε) reduces the ability to use sample data to learn about the characteristics, conditions, experi­ ences or behaviors of a population. Tat is, a large sampling error hinders statistical inference, where “inference” refers to the use of a sample-based statistic such as Χ as an estimate of the population parameter μ, within a specifed degree of precision. Agencies can address sampling error at two diferent stages of the production process—the design stage and the felding stage."

Agencies can address sampling error at two diferent stages of the production process—the design stage and the felding stage. At the design stage, agencies can choose, with considerable foreknowledge, how much variability or sampling error SE(ε) will be allowed in a survey. For example, they may reduce SE(ε) by collecting a large sample size, so long as budgetary resources are available. Te choice of the sample design will also impact sampling error, for example choosing a stratifed sample, rather than a simple random sample. High professional standards and careful implementation are needed so that the desirable statistical properties that a probability-based sample ofers in principle are achieved in practice. If executed well, a probability-based survey can be used to produce estimates of sampling error that are meaningful, that is, the estimates mea­ sure what they are designed to measure. Note that there is no inherent methodology trade-of between reducing sampling error and achieving other statistical goals, that is, a lower SE(ε) does not worsen, say, other dimensions of quality, except as they relate to cost. (FCSM 2001). Sampling error is typically captured through the standard error."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,74,"(FCSM 2001). Sampling error is typically captured through the standard error. As noted by the FCSM (2001, 1-6), “(f )or any survey based on a probability sample, data from the survey can be used to estimate the standard errors of survey estimates.” Its measure­ ment is ofen carried out via closed-form formulae that account for the sample design of the data. However, it may also be calculated through numerical methods such as balanced repeated replication (see, e.g., Kish and Frankel, 1970). CNSTAT (2017) describes sampling errors as measures of precision for survey estimates (p. 112) that provide the ability to measure the nature and extent of uncertainty in inferences to the full population (p. 89). Sampling error for a probability-based sur­ vey is measured and reported so that users can use the statistical information to support inference appropriately. Alternative­ ly, if sampling errors are not reported, statistical tools, such as replicate weights in microdata fles, by which researchers can generate their own estimates of sampling error, can be provided. By either method, users are enabled to conduct research, use the estimates, and make inferences appropriately. Sampling errors can be reported using coefcients of variation, standard errors, or confdence intervals."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,74,"By either method, users are enabled to conduct research, use the estimates, and make inferences appropriately. Sampling errors can be reported using coefcients of variation, standard errors, or confdence intervals. Te suitability of each concept depends on the type of variable. Based on the defnitions above, it may seem at frst that sampling error has no bearing on census data or, for that matter, on any data covering a population universe, or 100 percent of the population. However, another perspective is that a census can be interpreted as a type of a sample for some uses. Underlying this perspective is the argument that: “A census shows what resulted from this combination [of chance and underlying social and economic cause systems] at a certain time in the past, but any generalizations that are not restricted to a particular date and place must recognize the fact that some other population might have resulted, and must in fact be expected to arise in the future from the same underlying causes.” (Dem­ ing and Stephan, 1941, 45, emphasis added). Te issue of how to interpret census data, or other universe data such as vital records on births and deaths as a concrete example, arises when using such data to make statistical comparisons, forecasts, and hypothesis tests involving regions, groups or time periods and answer questions about whether such comparisons difer by “more than some level of natural fuctuations” (Brillinger, 1986, 693). FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 71 Nonresponse Error and Missing Data: A defnition of nonresponse error for survey data is “an error of nonobservation refecting an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the desired information from an eligible or sampled unit,” where the unit is eligible for inclusion in the survey (FCSM 2001, 1–6)."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,75,"FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 71 Nonresponse Error and Missing Data: A defnition of nonresponse error for survey data is “an error of nonobservation refecting an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the desired information from an eligible or sampled unit,” where the unit is eligible for inclusion in the survey (FCSM 2001, 1–6). In this context, a unit can refer to a sampled individual, household, establishment or other entity. Unit nonresponse occurs when no information is obtained from a sampled unit. When a sam­ pled unit provides information or answers to some, but not all questions, the missing responses are identifed as item non­ response. In addition to possible increases in bias, described below, nonresponse can decrease statistical precision through decreased sample sizes or, if the missing data are imputed, through added variability due to imputation. In nonsurvey data, unit missingness can be considered to be an analog to unit nonresponse in a survey; some members of the set of units chosen, targeted, or scheduled for inclusion in the dataset are not, for whatever reason, included. Although unit missingness would be called nonresponse in a survey setting, items may be missing from nonsurvey sources for various rea­ sons. Sensor and satellite data may be missing observations due to failing equipment, disruptions in signal detection, errors in recording or transmitting received signals, and such.

Administrative sources that rely on voluntary reporting can miss the observations of population members who have not provided data. Each of these sources of missingness may operate on the item level for nonsurvey data, for example if a voluntary reporter provides information on a subset of requested elements. As secondary uses of data are ofen not considered by the data collector, eforts to track and reduce these sources of missing data may not be as strongly pursued as for statistical data, collected explicitly for statistical use, and the eforts that are made to track and reduce missing data may not be systematically documented. Depending on missingness patterns, integrating data can mitigate or exacerbate the impact of missingness. Integrated data may have some observations dropped due to format incompatibilities or other logistical issues. If item or unit nonrespondents in a survey difer systematically from respondents (i.e., the nonrespondents are not missing at random), then the survey-based estimated value systematically deviates from the population parameter that the statistician seeks to measure, resulting in nonresponse bias. Missingness in nonsurvey and nonstatistical data has an analogous efect: if it is nonrandom with respect to the variable being measured, it results in bias. If nonresponse or missingness is completely random, then (this type of ) missingness does not cause bias. However, the conditions under which missingness is completely at random may be rare; instead, certain types of units may be more likely to exhibit missing data than other types of units."

However, the conditions under which missingness is completely at random may be rare; instead, certain types of units may be more likely to exhibit missing data than other types of units. Potentially, data on observable factors may (fully) account for this type of missingness. If so, then statistical techniques exist that can be used in estimation to eliminate any bias. Even if bias cannot be eliminated entirely, it may be satisfactory to use these techniques, together with at least some observable factors, to reduce potential bias. In “A Systematic Review of Nonresponse Bias Studies in Federally Sponsored Surveys” (FCSM 2020), the FCSM exam­ ined methods used in 165 eligible nonresponse bias studies conducted for federally sponsored surveys afer 2006. For this report, nonresponse bias methods were grouped into four categories: (1) benchmarking, (2) comparisons to external data, (3) studying variation within the respondent set, and (4) comparing alternative post-survey adjustments. Te authors report that comparisons of survey estimates to external data were the most commonly used method to assess nonresponse bias for establishment surveys whereas studying variations within the respondent set was the most commonly used method for household surveys. Such studies may be used to develop unbiased or less-biased estimates; alternatively, results can be report­ ed to provide data users with important information about nonresponse for their inferences from the data."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,75,"Such studies may be used to develop unbiased or less-biased estimates; alternatively, results can be report­ ed to provide data users with important information about nonresponse for their inferences from the data. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 72 FCSM Working Paper 31 (2001, 4-18 and 4-19) describes several reporting practices that agencies can use to inform users about the potential efects of nonresponse and missing data. In analytic reports, they may publish the response rates or missingness rates at the unit and item levels for various populations and subpopulations, identify the methods employed to adjust nonresponse or missingness, and report on studies that have been conducted to measure bias. In technical reports, they may provide additional details about the procedures used to mitigate nonresponse and missingness, report on evalua­ tions of these mitigation procedures, and describe steps taken to identify and address the underlying causes of nonresponse or missingness. For integrated data, sources having high rates of nonresponse or missingness may be excluded from the integrated data, espe­ cially if such missingness exacerbates other threats to data quality. Decisions about sources with missing data must weigh the inherent trade-ofs between potential losses in accuracy and reliability against potential gains in other quality dimensions such as relevance. Coverage Error To survey statisticians, the population of individuals, households, businesses or entities that the statisti­ cian aims to represent in the sample is the target population. In contrast, the population from which selected members are drawn for the survey sample is the frame population. Ideally, the target population and the frame population are the same, but diferences can emerge."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,76,"In contrast, the population from which selected members are drawn for the survey sample is the frame population. Ideally, the target population and the frame population are the same, but diferences can emerge. Statistical results are necessarily based on data at hand from a frame population from which a representative sample is drawn (survey data) or administrative data are collected (nonsurvey data). In either case, a disparity between the frame and target population means that data products do not fully represent the population of interest. FCSM Working Paper 31 identifed that “Te source of coverage error is the sampling frame itself ” (FCSM 2001, 1-6). Specifcally, coverage error occurs when the sampling frame difers from the target population (i.e., there is not a one-to-one match between the frame and the target population) (Groves et al. 2009, 55). Substantial coverage errors afect the ability of the user to make inferences about the target population. Undercoverage occurs when the frame used for sampling does not include all the units or people in the target population. Conversely, overcoverage occurs when the sampling frame includes more units or people than the target population (FCSM 2001, 1-6) In an address-based frame some housing units may be missed during enumeration and will result in undercover- age, (e.g., multiple housing units may not be apparent in subdivided houses). In contrast, if the frame is based on telephone numbers, households with two telephone numbers will be duplicated on the frame resulting in overcoverage."

In contrast, if the frame is based on telephone numbers, households with two telephone numbers will be duplicated on the frame resulting in overcoverage. Nonsurvey data contain errors that can be considered to be coverage errors. In nonsurvey data, the universe from which the data are actually drawn (a set that is the counterpart to the frame population) may not match the universe that data-based estimates are intended to represent (the target population). In nonsurvey data, it may not be as common as in survey data to defne and distinguish between a study’s target and actual (i.e., frame) universes formally, but such defnitions should be made explicit in documentation of nonsurvey data. In many secondary uses of nonsurvey data for statistical purposes, coverage errors may be especially common. Whereas frame populations in the survey context are usually chosen carefully to match the target population during the survey’s design stage, secondary uses of data usually exploit data sets whose frames were selected and developed independently from the secondary use. In addition, when data sets having diferent frames are integrated, the impact of coverage errors may be exacerbated. On the other hand, careful treatments may diminish coverage errors by optimally using diferent data sets to"
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,76,"On the other hand, careful treatments may diminish coverage errors by optimally using diferent data sets to FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 73 measure diferent segments of the target population. For example, Schenker, et al. (2002) combine data from the National Health Interview Survey and the National Nursing Home Survey to estimate the overall prevalence of health conditions among the elderly (living in either households or nursing homes). It is particularly useful to have at least one data set that covers the entire population for a set of key covariates when combining sources this way. For example, the National Postsec­ ondary Student Aid Study links to Federal Student Aid records for information on family ability to pay and the receipt of federal student aid; however, the Federal Student Aid records lack this key information for students whose families did not complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (also known as the FAFSA) (Wine et al. 2018). For statistical data, designed and collected for statistical purposes, such as survey data, it may be possible to consider specif­ cally how to limit coverage error by carefully specifying the target population and then collecting data from it. For secondary use of data originally collected for another purpose (nonstatistical data), it is not possible to change the data or specify its design. However, the threat of coverage error can be addressed in an indirect way by being aware of possible discrepancies between the frame population(s) used in the set(s) of data and the target population of interest. Such awareness reduces the chances of adopting statistical conclusions without caveats."

Such awareness reduces the chances of adopting statistical conclusions without caveats. Reporting on possible disparities between a target and a frame population for both statistical and nonstatistical data is one way to address coverage error; in so doing, data products based on the frame population are not improperly attributed to the target population. Tere can be uncertainty about the magnitude of coverage error, that is, the extent to which the frame population from which the nonsurvey records were drawn does not fully capture the desired target population. For example, some adminis­ trative datasets track the participants in a particular program; we may consider these participants to be a subset of a larger frame population of people who were eligible to participate in the program. Tat is, not all people who are eligible to par­ ticipate (the frame population) become actual participants. When there is unmeasured heterogeneity in the extent to which those eligible for a program were engaged to participate, it can result in ambiguity about how the frame population is best defned. Such ambiguity adds error to the mapping of the data to a target population. Tis issue highlights the importance of having good metadata and documentation for each data source. For example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study sample frame is matched to records at the Veteran’s Beneft Administration to identify veterans in the sample frame to allow for oversampling."

Processing Error: “Processing error occurs afer the survey data are collected, during the processes that convert reported data to published estimates and consistent machine-readable information. Each processing step . . . can generate errors in the data or in the published statistics.” (FCSM 2001, 1-6) As is the case with other types of errors, these errors occur when a survey value is diferent from the true response. Commonly cited types of processing error include data entry, coding, editing, imputation, and analysis (FCSM 2001, Czajka and Stange 2018, Eurostat 2020). Te 2020 European Statistical System Handbook for Quality Reports distinguishes between errors that occur in processing of the microdata into machine readable formats (see processing error examples above) and those errors that involve mistakes in implementing procedures (Eurostat 2020).

FCSM Working Paper 31 (FCSM 2001, 7-1) states “Data entry errors occur in the process of transferring collected data to an electronic medium.” Tis FCSM report acknowledges that in data entry, errors can be “considerably reduced” as the tech­ nology used for data entry increases from paper and pencil to automated scanning, to computer assisted data collection, and FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 74 to web collection techniques; it also cautions that “data entry errors occur even with technologically advanced techniques” (FCSM 2001 7-1). On the topic of coding edits, FCSM Working Paper 31 (FCSM 2001) indicates that “Most surveys require some type of pre-edit coding of the survey returns before they can be further processed in edit, imputation, and summary systems.” (FCSM 2001, 7-4). At this stage in processing—unit response— coding is used to indicate whether enough information was provided for a usable case. Item response coding is used to code short answer and open-ended responses into categorical responses. By the very nature of the fact that the coding is conducted by people and judgement is involved, the possibility of errors in coding is real."

By the very nature of the fact that the coding is conducted by people and judgement is involved, the possibility of errors in coding is real. Automated coding of open-ended responses also serves to decrease coding errors (FCSM 2001). Editing, and thus editing errors, occur at diferent points throughout processing (e.g., “from manual editing prior to a ma­ chine edit or from the manual correction of computer-generated error fags” (FCSM 2001, 7-6). Although editing is intend­ ed to improve the quality of the data, Working Paper 31 reported research showing that over-editing can add more error than it eliminates, so fnding the right balance is important. FCSM (2001) also discussed imputation error, noting that when imputation is used to replace missing or incorrect variables, the missing or erroneous data are replaced with values generated by an assumed model for the nonrespondents’ data. For example, in hot deck imputation, the problematic or missing values are replaced by reported values from other units in the survey. However, if the models are incorrect, the imputation process will introduce error. FCSM (2001) highlighted the point that “even if the imputation models are reasonable, imputation ofen attenuates measures of association among variables.” As a result, the authors stressed the importance of documenting imputation procedures and including imputation fags for imput­ ed cases to allow future analysts to remove the existing imputations and compute their own. Although most of the attention on processing error has been given to survey data and other data within the control of the statistical agency, less will be known about processing errors for external nonstatistical data obtained for statistical purposes, either on their own or for integrated data products."

It is likely that data processing will difer among external data providers and will change over time, so that processing errors for a particular data element could change with changes in data providers or their likely unknown processing steps, and these changes may remain unknown. Linkage Error: Record linkage is the integration of two or more record level data sets using unique or common identifers to produce a linked data fle with information from each source for each record. Linkage errors decrease the accuracy of linked data, which can lead to increased statistical bias and standard errors in the resulting estimates. Linkage errors are typ­ ically described as Type I (false match) or Type II (missed true matches). Te quality and type of identifcation information used to link cases has signifcant bearing on these error rates and the resulting accuracy of the linked data resource. To facilitate the highest quality linkages, the ideal situation is to have a unique identifer, such as an individual’s Social Se­ curity Number (SSN), associated with all records in the data sources to be linked. But ofen, such an identifer is missing in one or more of the data sources, making accurate record linkage more challenging."

But ofen, such an identifer is missing in one or more of the data sources, making accurate record linkage more challenging. For example, Massey and O’Hara (2014) used a combination of name, age, and birthplace as the core identifers to match 1940 Census records with data from later Census years, given the lack of a unique identifer on the 1940 Census fle. FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 75 Te two general approaches to record linkage are deterministic and probabilistic matching techniques (Dusetzina et al. 2014). Deterministic matching algorithms generally compare identifers or groups of identifers across two or more sources of data and set criteria for matches on exact agreement between the identifers. Deterministic matching algorithms tend to be rules based. Probabilistic matching algorithms generally calculate the probability or likelihood that two sets of records are correctly matched based on a sum of calculated probabilities for agreement and nonagreement for each identifer used in the linkage. Te weighting procedures to calculate the probabilities typically follow the Fellegi-Sunter paradigm which is the foundational methodology used for record linkage (Felligi and Sunter, 1969). When linking with a unique identifer such as an SSN, the deterministic methods may work well due to the fact that exact matches are required."

When linking with a unique identifer such as an SSN, the deterministic methods may work well due to the fact that exact matches are required. As a consequence, this approach tends to have fewer Type I (false) matches. But, if errors occur in the linking variable(s) (e.g., due to recording errors) or if the linking variables are not unique, the number of Type II (true missed matches) can increase (Grannis et al. 2002). For example, Handwerker, et al. (2011) used Employer Identifcation Numbers (EINs) to link frm-level data on foreign-owned businesses from the Bureau of Economic Analysis with establishment-level data on employment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since frms ofen use multiple EINs, and the frm-level data does not include all of each frm’s EINs, the project augmented its deterministic matching approach with auxiliary identifers, but still matched only 453 of the 500 manufacturers it studied. Probabilistic record linkage may be better for linking data when linking identifers may be subject to change over time and other reporting, measurement, or recording errors (Newcombe et al. 1959, Fellegi and Sunter 1969, Sayers et al. 2015, Har­ ron et al. 2017a). As the term implies, the probability of records matching is provided, and a cut-of score is used for deter­ mining a match and nonmatch. Sometimes a second score is used to separate matches, possible matches, and nonmatches. Te possible matches are then subjected to manual review."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,79,"Sometimes a second score is used to separate matches, possible matches, and nonmatches. Te possible matches are then subjected to manual review. As the cut-of values for matches and possible matches increase, the likelihood of incorrectly linking records decreases (Type 1) while the probability of missing matches increases (Type II) (Krewski et al. 2003). Te choice of optimal cut-of values is not straight forward at best and is ofen subjective. Manual re­ view of record pairs and plotting the distribution of matched weights are useful tools (Blakely and Salmond 2002, Dusetzina et al. 2014). If a single cut-of is used to identify matches and nonmatches, then setting that cut-of value can be aided by conducting sensitivity analyses. Evaluation work (empirical and theoretical) should be conducted to compare recommenda­ tions for best practices associated with probabilistic record linkage based on typical uses of the data. Harron et al. (2017a) provide three approaches to assessing the quality of record linkages: (1) applying the linkage algorithm to a subset of gold standard data to quantify linkage error, (2) comparing characteristics of linked and unlinked data to identify potential sources of bias, and (3) evaluating the sensitivity of results to changes in the linkage procedure, algorithm or thresholds. For example, the linkage of the National Hospital Care Survey with the NCHS National Death Index incor­ porated the three approaches: (1) a test deck/gold standard was created based on linking the SSN and other identifers for verifcation, (2) the discharge status was compared with the linked data to assess whether there was bias for those discharged dead and not linked, and (3) match weights were assessed to determine if diferent thresholds would produce diferent re­ sults (NCHS 2019).

Match weight thresholds were determined by the lowest total error for Type I and Type II errors. Type I and Type II errors were estimated using the gold standard approach, specifcally “Records that are matched by the probabilistic record linkage process but not the deterministic process are false positives [Type I]; those matched by the deterministic process but not the probabilistic process are false negatives [Type II]. From counts of these matches, Type I and Type II error rates can be determined” (NCHS 2019).

Te National Postsecondary Student Aid Study covers topics pertaining to student enrollment in postsecondary education, with a focus on how individuals and families fnance postsecondary education. It includes a student survey as well as the collection of data from the institutions in which the study students are enrolled. Record linkage is used to add administrative information from the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Ofce, the National Student Clearing House, the College Board, the ACT organization, and the Veterans Benefts Administration. Technical documentation provides information about each data source, including the match rates for linkage to each source (Wine et al. 2018), and including match rates for diferent subpopulations of interest.

For integrated data products, this means the process of map­ ping and synchronizing data derived from multiple sources into a coherent data fle for analysis. Harmonization can be im­ plemented using one source as a reference or gold standard or by using all sources to measure an underlying latent construct. Harmonization errors may increase statistical bias and decrease statistical precision of the resulting estimates. Harmonization errors arise when elements in each data source have been defned, collected, or processed diferently. Ex­ amples include the use of diferent classifcation systems, time periods or spatial supports, and the collection of diferent constructs, (e.g., completed years of education versus earned educational certifcates/degrees)."

Harmonization error can arise from many situations, including lack of enough information about, and quality of, source data, and its impact may difer among integration methods and uses. Integrating disparate sources may entail projecting estimates across time, geography, or classifcation system. Holan (2018), for example, describes methods for spatial and spa- tial-temporal data available for diferent geographic units and time periods (also known as the “change of support problem”) that could be used to harmonize data with diferent support, including recent Bayesian models (Bradley et al. 2016). Eforts to address measurement error in the source data may difer among sources and contribute to harmonization error. Survey questions measuring the same construct ofen difer among sources, particularly for items that are new or changing, such as sexual orientation and gender identity (see, e.g., Federal Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys 2016). Capturing similar information from administrative sources may be done in diferent ways. Harmonization of geographic information and other hierarchical structures can af­ fect granularity. As a result, harmonizing responses among various data sources may afect the accuracy and reliability of the integrated data product, particularly if some categories are coarsened for the resulting product, such as combining categories of race and ethnicity or collapsing geographic codes.

Jang (2018) describes data harmonization for the U.S. Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System, which includes data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and the National Survey of College Graduates. Combining data from these input sources allows for nationally representative estimates of the whole science and engineering population, increases temporal coverage and provides information over time. However, changes in sample designs, collection protocols, variable naming conventions, formats, and other factors over time required consistent coding and editing procedures, including harmonized response rate calculations, imputations, weighting, and variance es­ timation. Approaches for identifying, mitigating, and reporting harmonization error vary across elements and methods used. Al­ though some harmonization errors will arise from the increased opportunity for processing errors, others will follow from modeling and imputation methods or the assumptions needed to align data for estimation. As with other sources of error for nonstatistical and integrated data, external gold standard data can be used to identify, reduce, and report harmonization er­ ror. Other approaches include benchmarking the harmonized data to known subject-specifc and other relevant information and the use of sensitivity analysis.

Modeling Error: A special class of errors can be introduced when models are used to combine data.

Model-based methods for combining and integrating data include statistical matching or data fusion (Fosdick et al. 2016), imputation, Bayesian and/or hierarchical modeling, small area estimation, ensemble modeling, and calibration. New modeling approaches continue to be refned and developed, particularly for integrating emerging sources of data, such as satellite data or images. Machine learning and AI are special cases of modeling, albeit with a relatively greater reliance on empirical relationships in data on the outputs. Ensemble modeling is the process of ftting two or more related but difer­ ent models and then combining the results in order to improve the predictive accuracy (Seni and Elder 2010, Singh et al. 2020). Ensemble methods in data analytics can add errors as outputs from initial models, which are subject to estimation error, are integrated into blended data, and used as inputs into other analytical methods (Singh, et al. 2020) Modeling errors arise from inaccuracies in statistical model assumptions and from the efects of modeling decisions related to missing data, calibration variables and other constants, infuential observations, and other factors.

Modeling error is ofen expressed using measures of statistical precision and statistical bias, such as standard errors and margins of error, which refect sampling variability, and ‘goodness of ft’ statistics. A ‘best practice’ for statistical analysis continues to be segmenting data into training and testing sets to estimate these errors (Hastie et al. 2009). Modeling error for data products can also be evaluated using various approaches, including comparisons of model outputs to gold standard data, when available, and evaluations of the results using known subject-matter and other auxiliary information. Sensitivity analysis (discussed in more detail below in section B.4) is commonly used to evaluate statistical models, par­ ticularly those that rely on unverifable assumptions (Goldsmith 2015). New approaches to sensitivity analysis for model assessment continue to develop, particularly for machine learning and AI. For example, in a recent study, Lenis, et al. (2018) conduct a sensitivity analyses to investigate the consequences of model misspecifcation in the context of nonexperimental causal inference using a metric of model misspecifcation, termed the Degree of Misspecifcation, to explore which estima­ tors are most sensitive to misspecifcation of either the treatment or the outcome model. In their example, the authors illus­ trate graphically through simulation how the degree of model misspecifcation for both the treatment and outcomes models increases the bias and the root mean square error of the efect estimate. Although developed in the context of nonexperi­ mental causal inference, the approach can be extended when considering alternative models for integrating data."

Although developed in the context of nonexperi­ mental causal inference, the approach can be extended when considering alternative models for integrating data. In another recent example, Siddique et al. (2019) use sensitivity analyses to address the infuence of unverifable assumptions involv­ ing the measurement error process. In particular, they address the assumptions of treatment and time invariance through the process by assessing the sensitivity of inferences on the efect of treatment when measurement error model parameters change from baseline to follow-up. Results of sensitivity analysis ofen show that alternative models are compatible with the data and known subject matter information but lead to diferent estimates. Te more complex the models or number of data inputs, the more decisions and data features could be assessed with sen­ sitivity analysis. Although there is a need to move away from examining one parameter or aspect of the modeling process at a time to a more comprehensive approach, it is challenging to report aggregated numerical results across multiple di­ mensions. Bayesian and other Monte Carlo methods may be useful for assessing prior assumptions and multi-dimensional sensitivity.

Bayesian Model Averaging has been used to incorporate the uncertainty about the model in the interval estimate of a statistic (Fragoso et al. 2018). Visualization tools that can display outcomes across multiple alternatives are promising (see e.g., Rossen et al. 2020). Te Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program at the Census Bureau funded by NCES, provides model-based esti­ mates of income and poverty for the 3,141 counties and 13,206 school districts in the United States (Census Bureau 2020a). Estimates are produced by combining data from administrative records, postcensal population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates from the American Community Survey for single-year estimates. As modeling error can arise at various steps in the estimation process, the Census Bureau Quality Standards follows established standards for evaluating model-based estimates, including assessing model ft and performing sensitivity analysis (Census 2013). In addition to documentation providing an overview of the source data, including its timeliness, and the estimation ap­ proach, standard errors for all Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates model-based estimates are produced as indications of their overall quality. Te standard errors provided represent uncertainty due to the sampling variability within counties in the American Community Survey and “lack of ft” from the modeling process (Census 2017)."

Additional Treats to Accuracy Involving Geographic Data: Many statistics are tied to individual locations and are easily displayed and analyzed with geographic information systems. Te ease by which these systems allow the overlay of layers of data encourages spurious correlations among the layers and enables users to zoom in for geographic detail that is beyond the precision of the data. Statistics about geographic areas are afected by how the areas are defned and subdivided. In addition to previously men­ tioned issues of spatial Granularity, the size of geographic areas signifcantly afects density measures. Te population den­ sity of a city depends on how much surrounding rural area is included. How do the larger sizes of suburban census tracts compared to tracts in the center city afect neighborhood-level statistics? How are statistics on commercial activity in the census tracts afected by the delineation of census tracts to defne residential areas along major streets that tend to divide commercial districts? Distances between locations are ofen measured between centroids of the geographic units."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,83,"How are statistics on commercial activity in the census tracts afected by the delineation of census tracts to defne residential areas along major streets that tend to divide commercial districts? Distances between locations are ofen measured between centroids of the geographic units. Larger and fewer geographic units result in longer distances between units than smaller and more numerous geographic units for the same actual spatial distribution of activity. Even for small geographic units, is the activity being measured distributed evenly around the cen­ troid, or is the activity being measured on the periphery of the geographic unit? Changing the granularity for a data product does not always solve the statistical problems. Increasing the number of parti­ tions to reduce the distortion of centroids can divide functionally similar areas and result in spatial autocorrelation and bias in linear models. Reducing the number of partitions can result in too much heterogeneity within the zones that overwhelms any analysis of diferences between zones A key challenge in geographic analysis is that neighborhood characteristics are ofen used as a proxy for individual charac­ teristics because neighborhoods tend to attract similar residents and because a neighborhood can afect the character of its residents. Tese proxy measures add potential error from the variability among individual residents of the neighborhood as well as from efects that atypical residents can have on the behavior of others in the neighborhood.

Te most appropriate technique or combination of techniques applied depends on the type of error of interest and the resources available, including expertise, time, funds, and relevant external data. Comparison to Gold Standard: One method to evaluate threats for integrated data is to use a gold standard. A gold standard is ofen referred to as “an external source of truth” (Gordis 2014). When integrating sources through data linkage, Harron and colleagues describe the gold standard method as a way to “quantify errors (missed matches and false matches)” (Harron et al. 2017). However, fnding a truth source/gold standard that is representative of the study at hand may be dif­ fcult to obtain. Benchmarking to Known Information: A common practice to identify bias is to compare estimates to a benchmark or a standard. One example of this from integrating sources through data linkage is the assessment of linkage consent bias where estimates from the full population are compared to those who consented for their survey data to be linked. Sakshaug and Huber present this method as an assessment of absolute relative bias (Sakshaug and Huber 2015)."
FCSM.20.04_A_Framework_for_Data_Quality.pdf,84,"One example of this from integrating sources through data linkage is the assessment of linkage consent bias where estimates from the full population are compared to those who consented for their survey data to be linked. Sakshaug and Huber present this method as an assessment of absolute relative bias (Sakshaug and Huber 2015). A mitigation strategy if bias is found is to adjust survey sample weights for the sub-population that consented for linkage (Golden et al. 2015). However, there may be challenges with this method if there are systematic diferences between the benchmark and the comparison group. Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analyses can be used to evaluate some threats to accuracy and reliability, particularly when using nonstatistical and integrated data. Although sensitivity analysis includes multiple methods and approaches, generally such an analysis involves varying unverifable assumptions and decisions and examining their infuences on the resulting out­ puts ( Goldsmith 2005). Sensitivity analyses are particularly useful for evaluating errors unique or common for integrated data, such as modeling errors, harmonization errors, and linkage errors. As there are several approaches to integrating data, and resulting data products may have multiple outputs, sensitivity analyses take diferent forms when testing specifc statisti­ cal assumptions, model specifcations, linkage algorithms, infuential observations, calibration variables and other constants, and other subject-specifc assumptions and decisions. Te results of sensitivity analyses can difer among data outputs from a common data fle or data product, including estimates produced for population domains and/or at various geographic and temporal resolution. Although many analytic assumptions will be difcult to test or they will be untestable, the potential impact of violations of assumptions and benefts of potential mitigations are important in assessing accuracy and reliability."

Te more complex the integrated data product, the more data features that can be assessed with sensitivity analysis. Sensitiv­ ity analysis, however, can be time consuming and delay release of data or estimates. B.13 Conclusion Accuracy and reliability have been the cornerstone for assessing data quality. Data that are not accurate will not have high utility and will reduce the confdence users place in the data and the data producer. Identifying and measuring accuracy and reliability have been well-studied for survey data collected and disseminated by government agencies but are less devel­ oped for integrated data and for secondary uses of nonstatistical data, such as administrative records and data from satel­ lites and other monitoring devices. As such, many of the recommendations in this report focus on research to improve the ability to identify and measure accuracy and reliability for new and emerging data products and new uses of data by federal FCSM: A Framework for Data Quality 81 agencies."

In addition to research for better understanding the threats described above, methods for measuring, evaluating and propagating the errors across all input sources and from the integration steps are needed. Further, methods for fnding and using reference data, or gold standard data, to conduct these evaluations are needed. Disclosure risk protections afect accuracy and reliability and their impacts will increase with the complexity of data products and their ability to protect the data. Methods for fnding the right balance between accuracy and reliability and protecting the confdentiality of the data continue to be needed.

Regardless of data type or use, those working with data in the public sector should have a foundational understanding of the Data Ethics Tenets. Federal leaders should also foster a data ethics-driven culture and lead by example. The Data Ethics Tenets are: 1 - Uphold applicable statutes, regulations, professional practices, and ethical standards. Existing laws reflect and reinforce ethics. Therefore, data leaders and data users should adhere to all applicable legal authorities. Legal authorities often address historic situations and issues and may not keep pace with the evolving world of data and technology. Organizational leaders are encouraged to maintain up-to-date, comprehensive ethical standards regarding data use and staff are responsible for learning and applying agency guidance appropriately. 2 - Respect the public, individuals, and communities."

Data activities have the overarching goal of benefiting the public good. Responsible use of data begins with careful consideration of its potential impacts. Data initiatives should include considerations for unique community and local contexts and have an identified and clear benefit to society. 3 - Respect privacy and confidentiality. Privacy and confidentiality should always be protected in a manner that respects the dignity, rights, and freedom of data subjects. In this context, privacy is the state of being free from unwarranted intrusion into the private life of individuals, and confidentiality is the state of one’s information being free from inappropriate access and misuse. An essential objective of privacy and confidentiality protection is to minimize potential negative consequences through measures such as comprehensive risk assessments, disclosure avoidance, and upholding data governance standards. Data activities involving individual privacy should align with the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)."

All federal leaders and data users are expected to exhibit honesty and integrity in their work with data, regardless of job title, role, or data responsibilities. Federal leaders and data users should not perform or condone unethical data behaviors. When sharing data and findings, personnel should report information accurately and present any data limitations, known biases, and methods of analysis that apply. It should also be recognized that no dataset can fully represent all facets of a person, community, or issue. Federal leaders and data users are expected to have humility when presenting data, be open to feedback, and when possible invite discussion with the public. In addition, federal data users should accurately represent their abilities when working with data. 5 - Hold oneself and others accountable."
fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf,4,"In addition, federal data users should accurately represent their abilities when working with data. 5 - Hold oneself and others accountable. Accountability requires that anyone acquiring, managing, or using data be aware of stakeholders and be responsible to them, as appropriate. Remaining accountable includes the responsible handling of classified and controlled information, upholding data use agreements made with data providers, minimizing data collection, informing individuals and organizations of the potential uses of their data, and allowing for public access, amendment, and contestability to data and findings, where appropriate. 6 - Promote transparency. Individuals, organizations, and communities benefit when the ethical decision-making process is as transparent as possible to stakeholders. Transparency depends on clear communication of all aspects of data activities and appropriate engagement with data stakeholders. Promoting transparency requires engaging stakeholders through easily accessible feedback channels and providing timely updates on the progress and outcomes of data use. 7 - Stay informed of developments in the fields of data management and data science.

fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf,4,"7 - Stay informed of developments in the fields of data management and data science. Advanced technologies provide great benefit to the public sector, but should be deployed with a commitment to accountability and risk mitigation. While traditional data use and analysis can introduce bias, emerging systems, technologies, and techniques require additional awareness and oversight because they can increase opportunities for bias. It is critical to remain informed of developments in the fields of data management and data science, especially as advanced methods impact future data collection, management, and use. In addition, new data innovations (e.g., systems, solutions, computational methods) emerge every day, increasing the importance for federal leaders and employees working with data to keep abreast of market innovations and learn how to ethically use new methods.

The new world of data ethics2 The United States Federal Government is one of the biggest producers and users of data in the world. The exchange of information—or data—with government is necessary for regular tasks, such as renewing a passport, signing up for public assistance programs, and filing taxes. While Americans prize their personal privacy, they are also willing to give information about themselves if it drives a service or concrete public benefit, such as sharing location data to support emergency responders. Similar to entities worldwide, the functions of the Federal Government rely on data for daily operation, management, and improvement. The ways in which data are collected, linked, analyzed, and shared present tremendous opportunities for government. However, these opportunities are accompanied by significant risks— sometimes unforeseen—to the individuals and communities the government serves. International, state, and local governments, as well as private companies, are making significant strides in the field of data ethics to preserve the benefits and mitigate the risks of data use."

The Federal Government plays a critical role in setting the example of ethical oversight by making responsible data decisions and supporting proven values that promote the public good. Introduction The Federal Data Strategy, delivered in December 2019, recognized the importance of ethics in its founding principles. The Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan required the development of a Data Ethics Framework (Framework) that is intended to help agency employees, managers, and leaders make ethical decisions as they acquire, manage, and use data. The Framework and its Tenets are a “living” resource and are to be updated by the CDO Council and ICSP every 24 months to ensure the Framework remains current. The Framework applies to all data types and data uses and incorporates the input and terminology from stakeholders representing many domains, who use different types of data in different ways. The developers of the Framework recognize that some terms may be used differently, depending on the context, type of data being used, and stage in the data lifecycle.

Federal Data Strategy Data Ethics Framework STRATEGY.DATA.GOV Page 8 RESOURCES.DATA.GOV About the Data Ethics Framework Purpose The Framework’s purpose is to guide federal leaders and data users as they make ethical decisions when acquiring, managing, and using data to support their agency’s mission. The Framework does not include requirements or mandates of its own, but rather provides guidance in the form of Tenets to encourage ethical decision making at all levels of the Federal Government. Audience The Framework is intended for use by anyone in the Federal Government who works with or leads work involving data, including employees, contractors, grantees, researchers, and other partners who work on behalf of or as an agent of the government. The ethical use of data is both an individual and organizational responsibility, involving many stakeholder groups that can be internal or external to an agency. In particular, the Framework is relevant to those who work with data during any stage of the data lifecycle, shown in Figure 1, including collecting, processing, disseminating, using, or storing and disposing of data. This includes: • Organizational leaders, including Chief Data Officers (CDOs), Statistical Officials, Evaluation Officers (EOs) heads of agencies, senior executives, and supervisors • Data practitioners, such as statisticians, data analysts, database professionals, and data scientists • Program evaluators and operational employees who collect, use, manage, and report data for regular program operations • Policymakers and those advising decision makers • Data stewards, including both those who manage data for programmatic purposes and those who manage administrative data, such as human resource employees • Public relations officials, communications employees, and agency representatives who present information and data to the public • Data consumers, such as other agencies, communities, or the public • Research grant recipients across all disciplines Figure 1: Data Lifecycle adopted from OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource Federal Data Strategy Data Ethics Framework STRATEGY.DATA.GOV"

fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf,9,"Federal Data Strategy Data Ethics Framework STRATEGY.DATA.GOV Page 9 RESOURCES.DATA.GOV Data Ethics Defined In the simplest terms, data refer to factual information, such as measurements or statistics, used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.3 Data Ethics are the norms of behavior that promote appropriate judgments and accountability when acquiring, managing, or using data, with the goals of protecting civil liberties, minimizing risks to individuals and society, and maximizing the public good. Remaining a leader in data ethics requires individuals, agencies, and cross-agency communities to acknowledge that legal compliance does not guarantee ethical behavior. Therefore, federal leaders and data users must embrace a culture of ongoing discussion, engagement, and learning. Instead of looking at issues from a single perspective, ethical decision making is best achieved by taking a holistic approach and widening the context to weigh the greater implications of data use. Application of Data Ethics The Data Ethics Tenets apply to all federal data types and data uses. It is understood that the same dataset may be used at different times for different purposes. No matter the data type or use, federal employees should ensure the protection of privacy, confidentiality, civil rights, and civil liberties during data activities. For decades, Federal Government laws and regulations4 distinguished between data uses that can have significantly different ethical impacts (e.g., statistical and non-statistical)."
fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf,9,"No matter the data type or use, federal employees should ensure the protection of privacy, confidentiality, civil rights, and civil liberties during data activities. For decades, Federal Government laws and regulations4 distinguished between data uses that can have significantly different ethical impacts (e.g., statistical and non-statistical). This distinction ensures the protection of data, while also enabling the government to better understand the effectiveness of programs and services. The Federal Government recognizes that work with some data, such as weather datasets, requires less scrutiny and is inherently lower risk than information protected by privacy and confidentiality assurances, that require more scrutiny and a full assessment of potential impacts. Each community or agency is ultimately responsible for applying this Framework appropriately based on the context and level of risk for the relevant data. Additional information on this dichotomy is described in Figure 2. Statistical Data Uses: Statistical activities across the federal enterprise continue to play a vital role in research and program evaluation contributing to policymaking. The design of the Federal Statistical System supports the secure and confidential use of sensitive data exclusively for statistical purposes. Data used for statistical purposes includes describing, estimating, and analyzing the characteristics of a group without identifying the individuals or organizations that make up that group. Statistical data use is governed by a set of enabling legal authorities and protections to reduce collection burden on individuals and businesses, improve the quality of analyses produced by the government, ensure objectivity, and promote the public’s trust and confidence in federal use of confidential data while deriving benefits for society. Non-Statistical Data Uses: Data are often gathered and used to manage the day-to-day work of government services, including for administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, and adjudicative purposes."

Non-Statistical Data Uses: Data are often gathered and used to manage the day-to-day work of government services, including for administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, and adjudicative purposes. For example, program administrators often use data to make decisions on an applicant’s request to receive funds from a benefits program such as Social Security or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Non-statistical data are not governed by the same institutional structures, safeguards, and explicit legal authorities as data used for statistical purposes. For example, using data for daily management of programs requires authorized government personnel to view and make decisions on program delivery using sensitive and confidential data.

Respect the Public, Individuals, and Communities Data activities have the overarching goal of benefiting the public good. All other Tenets support this notion, and responsible federal leaders and data users should approach data activities with promoting the “public good” in mind. Responsible use of data begins with careful consideration of its potential and differential impacts. Data initiatives should include considerations for unique community and local contexts, such as for federally recognized Tribes, Alaskan Natives, and local governments, and have an identified and clear benefit to society. In situations where data on individuals or communities are used to deliver services, data users should engage with impacted stakeholders to better understand those represented by the data and honor guarantees made to data subjects."

Stay Informed of Developments in the Fields of Data Management and Data Science Advanced technologies provide great benefit to the public sector, but should be deployed with a commitment to accountability and risk mitigation. Emerging systems, technologies, and techniques require additional awareness and oversight as they can present new—and sometimes hard to detect—opportunities for bias. Below are examples of why emerging systems, technologies, and techniques require additional oversight. • Responsibility for emerging systems, technologies, and techniques may fall to those who do not have the requisite training or experience to perform the work. • Advanced technologies and computational methods can lead to algorithms and automations that make probabilistic recommendations and decisions on behalf of programs (e.g., acceptance of application for benefit program) with minimal human oversight. • Automations and probabilistic recommendations may have differential impacts that can only be identified through deep analysis and review (e.g., facial recognition technology that benefits one group while having serious negative consequences for another). Since new data innovations emerge every day, federal leaders and data users should keep abreast of innovations and how to use those methods in an ethical manner. Examples of advanced technologies, analytics, and computational methods that should be monitored and assessed are below. • Artificial Intelligence (AI) • Machine Learning (ML) • Neural Networks (NNs) • Robotic Process Automation (RPA) • Internet of Things (IoT) • Blockchain Refer to Figures 9 and 10 for additional recommendations, legal authorities, and resources."

Use Case: Artificial Intelligence & Bias Artificial Intelligence & Bias Organization Type: Government Benefit Agency Primary Objective: Improve administration of government benefits Secondary Objective: Leverage administrative data and advanced technologies (i.e., AI) to improve performance Scenario: An agency that oversees administration of benefits collects large amounts of applicant data on a daily basis. To streamline the application process, the agency engaged an outside party to create an automated tool that makes decisions on applicant eligibility for the benefits program. The tool relies on models that gather data from different parts of the organization, including applicant employment and financial records, and analyzes the chances of applicant success within the program. In operation for over two years, the tool helps eliminate numerous manual processes, identifies potential fraud, and better deploys limited resources."

In operation for over two years, the tool helps eliminate numerous manual processes, identifies potential fraud, and better deploys limited resources. During this time, the tool has made thousands of decisions on applicant eligibility for benefits, impacting countless lives. Judy, who works for the agency’s outreach department, has received an increasing volume of complaints from applicants in recent months. Applicants have consistently stated they are inappropriately screened and removed from the application process. Judy brings this issue to her management, which requests an internal review. The internal review finds that data sharing agreements required for the original, underlying data to be destroyed upon the tool’s deployment on the agency’s customer-facing website. As a result, the agency is unable to reproduce, assess, or scrutinize aspects of the tool and its supporting decision models.

The government inspection agency enforces this law, setting minimum standards as the baseline by which they assess a facility’s care for animals. Each year, the agency collects, manages, and analyzes AWA records from animal facilities (e.g., animal shelters, retailers) to support its mission and perform reporting. In addition, the agency posts information and investigations and inspections results to a public website. The reports give the public a picture of the compliance of all entities licensed or registered under the AWA. Due to a pending lawsuit and privacy concerns, the government inspection agency removed certain reports and AWA records from its website that identified animal abuse complaints (i.e., complaints not convictions). Users, activists, and the public were upset, as posting the AWA records not only seemed like the right thing to do, but the agency has also taken measures to redact some information previously posted. The agency communications department is in a difficult situation—there is a demand for public transparency, but legal matters and a transition in agency leadership leave the team with conflicting views on how to proceed.

This expansion in data use poses challenges for how agencies execute data-related activities as each agency faces a different set of infrastructure challenges, abides by different mission parameters, and maintains a unique culture. In this evolving environment, working with data and data management have become disciplines key to organizational success. The importance of data is reflected in new legislative focus on ensuring that agencies are effectively incorporating data in fulfilling their missions. For example, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (hereinafter “Evidence Act”) requires that CFO Act agencies1 develop a learning agenda plan every four years as part of their strategic plan. These learning agendas identify agency key questions based on consultation with internal and external stakeholders, give agencies the opportunity to identify key questions related to mission and operations, and include short- and long- term questions."

By using data to address key questions, agency leaders can develop evidence-based solutions to organizational challenges and improve mission and operational outcomes. Effective data leadership is critical to the success of the learning process envisioned in the Evidence Act. The Federal Data Strategy (hereinafter “Strategy”) supports a coordinated approach to federal data leadership, including data use and management, to help agencies deliver on mission in the 21st century. By guiding agencies in establishing more consistent and integrated data infrastructure and data practices, the Strategy seeks to move the Federal Government toward fully leveraging data as a strategic asset, including supporting strong data governance and providing the data protection and security the American people deserve. The Strategy consists of a mission statement articulating the intent and core purpose of the Strategy, 10 principles serving as motivational guidelines, and 40 practices informing agencies on leveraging the value of data. The mission statement, principles, and practices are presented in final form in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-19-18, and additional detail regarding their deployment can be found at strategy.data.gov. This playbook will help agencies implement the Strategy and fulfill the requirements of the Evidence Act by improving their organizsational leadership for leveraging data as a strategic asset. 1 This Evidence Act provision applies to the 24 CFO Act agencies named in section 901(b) of title 31: The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Agency for International Development, General Services Administration, National Science Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Personnel Management, Small Business Administration, and Social Security Administration."

The two “plays” included here are designed to help agencies improve their organizational leadership for leveraging data as an asset and respond to the requirements of the Evidence Act. Each play includes activities for building data infrastructure through data governance bodies and maturity assessments. These activities create the foundation for developing a data-driven culture in which agencies are poised to embrace the Strategy’s mission statement, principles, and practices.

Rather, each agency should consider its current organizational environment, structure, culture, and capacity to decide how to implement the plays. Agencies should prioritize and adapt the individual checklist items in ways that make the most sense for their own organization. In addition, implementing these plays should create significant organizational learning, especially in the initial years, so agencies should plan to regularly review and update their data governance approach and ensure it supports their learning agenda.

fds-data-governance-playbook.pdf,5,"Page 5 RESOURCES.DATA.GOV Play 1: Data Governance Step 1 – Establishing a Data Governance Body What? Data governance is the process of setting and enforcing priorities for managing and using data as a strategic asset. A data governance body with authority and oversight over the management of agency data assets is a key piece of data infrastructure. These bodies are commonly called by such names as Data Governance Boards, Data Councils, or Data Strategy Teams. The data governance body establishes policies, procedures, and roles for developing, overseeing, and coordinating data management policy and helps prioritize data resource allocations to answer agency key questions and meet stakeholder needs. When? An effective data governance body is foundational to leveraging data as a strategic asset and a critical precursor to making conscious and realistic decisions about stewarding data assets and developing related data infrastructure. Agencies should make establishing a data governance body a top priority, thereby setting up the organizational structure to address data and related infrastructure needs. Who? A data governance body is authorized and chartered by the agency head or delegated authority, chaired by the Chief Data Officer (CDO), and includes senior staff with responsibility for diverse aspects of data management as well as senior officials from agency program areas."

A data governance body is authorized and chartered by the agency head or delegated authority, chaired by the Chief Data Officer (CDO), and includes senior staff with responsibility for diverse aspects of data management as well as senior officials from agency program areas. In addition to the CDO, membership should include the Evaluation Official (EO) and the Statistical Official (SO) named in accordance with the Evidence Act. Agencies should consider their own needs and structure as well as related OMB guidance, such as M-19-23, in identifying other senior leaders for membership. Finally, to be truly effective, executive leaders must get regular updates about the data governance body’s impact and hold its members accountable for raising the organization’s data maturity. How? An agency data governance body identifies the scope of the data that needs to be managed and prioritizes key data-related issues that need to be addressed. Then it identifies appropriate policies, standards, and reporting structures to ensure that key information assets are formally and properly managed. The data governance body uses maturity models to assess agency capabilities and seeks meaningful and broad agency and stakeholder input before recommending data investment priorities (see Play 2). It also sets forth a process for monitoring compliance with policies, standards, and responsibilities throughout the information lifecycle."

Each agency should consider its vision for how it will leverage data to address agency key questions and meet stakeholder needs. The vision should identify agency leadership goals and expectations for using data to achieve mission and improve operations. It should also address the agency values that will drive decisions about data governance and management including how to align agency resources and prioritize its efforts. While the vision and its implementation will change over time, a clear statement of agency vision and values can help shape an effective data governance process from the outset. Effective data governance and management often requires a change in culture. Therefore, the vision should drive a shared data culture and support small, interim successes to build towards long-term success. It should also emphasize collaboration as a keystone for the success of the agency’s vision and empower data stakeholders to make decisions for which they will be held accountable. When?"

The CDO should solicit and incorporate the views of agency executive leadership to ensure the vision is aligned with agency policies and priorities. Data governance body members should take an active part in creating the vision, so it is relevant throughout the agency. How? The CDO should work with agency leadership and senior executives throughout the organization to develop a vision that is consistent with agency goals and realistic as a basis for determining resource priorities and for developing the strategic information resources management plan required by the Evidence Act.

Maturity assessments allow an organization to evaluate itself against documented best practices, determine gaps, and identify areas to prioritize for improvement. A maturity assessment analyzes all aspects of agency policies, procedures, and operations related to data and data infrastructure, including data governance, data management, data culture, data systems and tools, data analytics, staff skills and capacity, resource capacity, and compliance with law and policy. The results of a maturity assessment feed into the data governance and management processes to inform investment decisions and to prioritize subsequent actions. A maturity assessment should be repeated periodically, as determined by the agency, to measure progress and prioritize next steps. When? An assessment of agency data and related infrastructure maturity provides a starting point for prioritizing time and resources to improve the agency’s data assets and how they are managed."
fds-data-governance-playbook.pdf,9,"When? An assessment of agency data and related infrastructure maturity provides a starting point for prioritizing time and resources to improve the agency’s data assets and how they are managed. The assessment helps the agency determine which areas of data and data maturity are most mature and which ones need further attention and development. Therefore, assessing data maturity should be one of the data governance body’s first activities. Who? The data governance body, in consultation with agency stakeholders, should choose, adapt, or create the data maturity assessment model, conduct the assessment, evaluate the results, and make recommendations for next steps to improve agency data and related infrastructure maturity. The data governance body should also evaluate the usefulness of the assessment model and make recommendations for changes for subsequent assessments. The data governance body may wish to establish a subcommittee for this activity. How? For many agencies, a targeted focus on data governance and management will result in new operating processes and promote a shift in culture towards leveraging data as a strategic asset."
fds-data-governance-playbook.pdf,9,"How? For many agencies, a targeted focus on data governance and management will result in new operating processes and promote a shift in culture towards leveraging data as a strategic asset. Therefore, the data governance body should engage agency stakeholders and solicit input on the current state of the agency’s data management activities when selecting a data maturity assessment model. Agencies may wish to select a model that is roughly aligned with their current capacity and can measure the agency’s current successes while identifying areas for improvement. Agencies should select a model that balances the information they need and the resources they have for assessment and, in the selection process, consider their previous experience with maturity assessments and the types of action that can be taken based on the results. The results of the maturity assessment help the agency prioritize time and resources to improve their data and related infrastructure. Over time, agencies can move to more complex data maturity assessment models to build capacity and attain higher levels of maturity. The MAX Federal Community website community.max.gov/display/DATA/Federal+Data+Strategy will include a collection of references and examples of commonly used data maturity assessment models, including both open-source and proprietary models. The inclusion of proprietary assessment models should not be interpreted as an endorsement of any particular product or service.

Federal Data Strategy Data Governance Playbook STRATEGY.DATA.GOV Page 11 RESOURCES.DATA.GOV Step 2 – Establishing Agency Data Architecture Guidance What? Agency data architecture guidance is designed to ensure that data systems have consistent metadata to promote interoperability, minimize redundancy, and improve the user experience. Agency architecture guidance includes identifying authoritative data systems and establishing common schema for specific data elements. For example, an agency might identify one specific data system as the “master” for social security number and set a standard for how social security numbers will be stored. To establish data architecture guidance, agencies need to have a good inventory of data assets that includes metadata with information about what data elements are included for each asset and how the data elements are stored."

To establish data architecture guidance, agencies need to have a good inventory of data assets that includes metadata with information about what data elements are included for each asset and how the data elements are stored. Developing this inventory will also help agencies meet the requirements of the Evidence Act. When? Establishing agency data architecture guidance is one of the first substantive tasks the data governance body will need to undertake because it affects the effective and efficient operation of all the agency’s data systems. Agencies should prioritize the establishment of data architecture guidance for those data elements that are key to their mission and operational processes. Data elements that define the agency’s customers (e.g., name, address, social security number) are likely to be highest priority as they often exist across data systems and lack of consistency can be a barrier to effective customer service and data interoperability. Who? The data governance body should lead the development of agency data architecture guidance, monitor its progress, and evaluate its effectiveness. The data governance body may wish to establish a subcommittee and engage relevant technical staff in this process."

The data governance body may wish to establish a subcommittee and engage relevant technical staff in this process. Agency leaders performing the functions of a Chief Enterprise Architect or Chief Data Architect will play a key role in developing the technical specifications for agency data architecture guidance; the data governance body’s implementation guidance should focus on promoting efficiency among business units. How? The data governance body should work with agency stakeholders to identify and prioritize common data elements, establish guidance for related metadata, and designate authoritative data systems for common elements. Often this means focusing on data elements that define the agency’s customers (e.g., name, address, social security number). The data governance body should ensure that all agency stakeholders know about the new guidance and why it is important for all agency data systems to adhere to agency-wide standards. Emphasize the overall cost efficiencies inherent in consolidating data systems such as increasing standardization, reducing risk management activities, and eliminating data duplication and burden on operations staff and data analysts. Listen to the concerns of agency stakeholders about potential risks and work within the agency to mitigate those risks. It is also critical to help staff and leaders understand that the process of improving data architecture is likely to identify multiple data challenges and opportunities."

Federal Data Strategy Data Governance Playbook STRATEGY.DATA.GOV Page 13 RESOURCES.DATA.GOV Data Governance Resources Federal, state and local governments across the United States are now beginning or are in the midst of major reforms and transformations to the way that they approach the data they manage. An incredible body of knowledge, learned expertise, and tools have emerged from early adopters of these reforms. There are now many models, resources, and communities of practice that agencies can and should consult when building out their data governance body. To that end, the Federal Data Strategy development team is contributing to a repository found at resources.data.gov. This repository will eventually include a range of resources related to data governance and management, including a guide to maturity models that can be used to conduct self-assessments, and a list of communities of practice where agency staff can connect with other data practitioners.

(4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

(5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.

(6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data. (7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced. (8) Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States may, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law."

(9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. (10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation."

In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN (11) Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States. (12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data. (13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States."

The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.

In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation.

However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. (19) The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation. With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State."

Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories. (20) While this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or Member State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision- making. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this Regulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations.

That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between Member States. (22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. 4.5.2016 L 119/4 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal).

(23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. (24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. (25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post. (26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person."
General_Data_Protection_Regulation.pdf,5,"(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.

(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudony­ misation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi­ sation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller. 4.5.2016 L 119/5 Official Journal of the European Union EN (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.

(31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis­ trative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. (32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data.

(33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research.

The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation.

An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings. (38) Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child.

That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.

Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.

In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent pre- formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. (43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.

(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.

Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. (47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing.

The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.

In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their 4.5.2016 L 119/9 Official Journal of the European Union EN further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.

However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. (51) Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systemati­ cally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms."

(52) Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. (53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes 4.5.2016 L 119/10 Official Journal of the European Union EN by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons.

Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data. (54) The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, ‘public health’ should be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.

(55) Moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest. (56) Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established. (57) If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the data controller. (58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used."

Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand. (59) Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests. 4.5.2016 L 119/11 Official Journal of the European Union EN (1) Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70)."

(60) The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the intended processing.

Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided. (62) However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already possesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a dispropor­ tionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration. (63)"
General_Data_Protection_Regulation.pdf,12,"In that regard, the number of data subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration. (63) A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates. (64) The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers."

A controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests. (65) A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given 4.5.2016 L 119/12 Official Journal of the European Union EN his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.

In doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject's request. (67) Methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system. (68) To further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out by automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract.

It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.

That right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information. 4.5.2016 L 119/13 Official Journal of the European Union EN (71) The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes ‘profiling’ that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent.

Such measure should not concern a child. In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. Automated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should be allowed only under specific conditions. (72) Profiling is subject to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles.

Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. 4.5.2016 L 119/14 Official Journal of the European Union EN (75) The risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; where personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects. (76) The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment, by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk.

(78) The protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and processing of personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling the controller to create and improve security features. When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers of the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations. The principles of data protection by design and by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders. (79) The protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation to the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear allocation of the responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller. (80) Where a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal data of data subjects who are in the Union whose processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the controller or the processor should designate a representative, unless the processing is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of special categories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the 4.5.2016 L 119/15 Official Journal of the European Union EN"

The designated representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor. (81) To ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a processor with processing activities, the controller should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge, reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this Regulation, including for the security of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller.

Each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might serve for monitoring those processing operations. (83) In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected."

Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical, material or non-material damage. (84) In order to enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that risk. The outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a data-protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing. (85) A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned.

Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours, the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. (86) The controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue delay, where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication. (87) It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject."

The fact that the notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation. (88) In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investi­ gation of the circumstances of a personal data breach. (89) Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes."

Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing. (90) In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compliance with this Regulation. (91) This should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount of personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights. A data 4.5.2016 L 119/17 Official Journal of the European Union EN protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categories of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures. A data protection impact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale."

The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician, other health care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory. (92) There are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection impact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal activity. (93) In the context of the adoption of the Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, Member States may deem it necessary to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities. (94) Where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities. Such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and frequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person. The supervisory authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified period."

As part of that consultation process, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority, in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

In particular, such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

(101) Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any event, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor. (102) This Regulation is without prejudice to international agreements concluded between the Union and third countries regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for the data subjects. Member States may conclude international agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or in­ ternational organisations, as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions of Union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects."

In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress. (105) Apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations.

Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective adminis­ trative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data protection by design and by default.

Provision should also be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be made only at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients, taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject. (112) Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations, between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social security matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport. A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another person's vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the data subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States should notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject."

The controller should give particular considera­ tion to the nature of the personal data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the country of final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into con­ sideration.

This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.

General_Data_Protection_Regulation.pdf,22,"(116) When personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent legal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information and carry out investigations with their international counterparts. For the purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based on reciprocity and in accordance with this Regulation. (117) The establishment of supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and exercise their powers with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure. (118)"

(118) The independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review. (119) Where a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member State should in particular designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission. (120) Each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate, public annual budget, which may be part of the overall state or national budget.

General_Data_Protection_Regulation.pdf,23,"This should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject, conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. (123) The supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the internal market. For that purpose, the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission, without the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of mutual assistance or on such cooperation. (124) Where the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, or where processing taking place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State, the supervisory authority for the main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate with the other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their Member State, because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint has been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member State has lodged a complaint, the supervisory authority with which such complaint has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned. Within its tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation, the Board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State and on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection. (125) The lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation."
General_Data_Protection_Regulation.pdf,23,"(125) The lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as lead authority, the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. Where the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part, that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged. (126) The decision should be agreed jointly by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on the controller and processor. The controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the Union. (127) Each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single Member State and involves only data subjects in that single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State. In such cases, the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead supervisory authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned (‘one-stop-shop mechanism’), or whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level."

After being informed, the lead supervisory authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned (‘one-stop-shop mechanism’), or whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level. When deciding whether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-à-vis the controller or processor. Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case, the supervisory authority which informed it should have the 4.5.2016 L 119/23 Official Journal of the European Union EN possibility to submit a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism. (128) The rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only supervisory authority competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation should be the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority or private body is established. (129) In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers of investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation and advisory powers, in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons, and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under Member State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings."

Such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation, including a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection of personal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned. Investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in Member State procedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an effective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to Member State procedural law. The adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision."

The adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision. (130) Where the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory authority, the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation. In such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative fines, take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any investigation on the territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent supervisory authority. (131) Where another supervisory authority should act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor in the Member State where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail possible infringements of this Regulation should seek an amicable settlement with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range of powers. This should include: specific processing carried out in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in the context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority; or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under Member State law. (132) Awareness-raising activities by supervisory authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context. 4.5.2016 L 119/24 Official Journal of the European Union EN (133) The supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this Regulation in the internal market."

A supervisory authority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority. (134) Each supervisory authority should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory authorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond to the request within a specified time period. (135) In order to ensure the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established. That mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member States. It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism."

It should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties. (136) In applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period of time, issue an opinion, if a majority of its members so decides or if so requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission. The Board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue, in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members, legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory authorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case, in particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation. (137) There may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A supervisory authority should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three months."

In other cases of cross- border relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering the consistency mechanism. (139) In order to promote the consistent application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent body of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality. The Board should be represented by its Chair.

The Commission should participate in the Board's activities without voting rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the Commission, in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international organisations, and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks. (140) The Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection Supervisor.

The investi­ gation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the submission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding other means of communication. (142) Where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed, he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State may provide for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate, and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this Regulation."

As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's procedural law."

Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. Where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring proceedings before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating to the application of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation. Furthermore, where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision of the Board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare the Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a national court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was directly and individually concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down in Article 263 TFEU.

(146) The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State law.

However, where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State law, compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing, provided that full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing.

In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor.

Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority should take account of the general level of income in the Member State as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine. The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines.

(151) The legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided that such an application of the rules in those Member States has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by the supervisory authority initiating the fine.

Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest. Personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public authority or public body is subject.

(157) By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries, research results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained through registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services.

Information collections employing surveys are frequently used for general purpose statistics, as well as for program evaluations or research studies that answer more specific research questions. Data collected by Federal agencies are widely used to make informed decisions and to provide necessary information for policy makers and planners. The collection of this information can take many forms and is accomplished in a variety of ways. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires agencies to submit requests to collect information from the public to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,5,"The collection of this information can take many forms and is accomplished in a variety of ways. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires agencies to submit requests to collect information from the public to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. This guidance is designed to assist agencies and their contractors in preparing Information Collection Requests (ICRs), which may be commonly known as PRA submissions or “OMB clearance packages,” for surveys used for general purpose statistics or as part of program evaluations or research studies. 1. What is the purpose of this guidance? OMB is often asked about the ICR review process and what its expectations are, especially for collections involving surveys. These Q&As are designed to answer many of the frequently asked questions to help agencies better understand OMB’s expectations for survey information collection requests. This improved understanding should assist agencies in identifying and documenting information for inclusion in their ICRs, and should facilitate the review process.

pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,6,"The collection of this information can take many forms and is accomplished in a variety of ways. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) requires agencies to submit requests to collect information from the public to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. This guidance is designed to assist agencies and their contractors in preparing Information Collection Requests (ICRs), which may be commonly known as PRA submissions or “OMB clearance packages,” for surveys used for general purpose statistics or as part of program evaluations or research studies. 1. What is the purpose of this guidance? OMB is often asked about the ICR review process and what its expectations are, especially for collections involving surveys. These Q&As are designed to answer many of the frequently asked questions to help agencies better understand OMB’s expectations for survey information collection requests. This improved understanding should assist agencies in identifying and documenting information for inclusion in their ICRs, and should facilitate the review process.

When should an agency begin the PRA process? The PRA requires that the agency publish a 60-day notice in the Federal Register to obtain public comment on the proposed collection, prior to submitting the information collection to OMB.1 At the time this notice is published, agencies must have at least a draft survey instrument available for the public to review. Agencies should state in their ICRs whether any comments were received from the public, and the comments should be addressed in the ICR that is submitted to OMB. When submitting the ICR to OMB, agencies are required to place a second notice in the Federal Register, allowing a 30-day public comment period and notifying the public that OMB approval is being sought and that comments may be submitted to OMB. This notice runs concurrent with the first 30 days of OMB review, and OMB has a total of 60 days after receipt of the ICR to make its decision.2 Thus, agencies need to allow at least 120 days for consideration of initial public comments, the second public comment period and OMB review, plus additional time for preparation of the ICR, as well as time lags for publication of Federal Register notices. Agencies may also have requirements for internal review or higher level reviews (e.g., departmental) that need to be factored into the schedule for planning a survey. A six month period, from the time the agency completes the ICR to OMB approval, is fairly common for planning purposes but varies considerably across agencies depending on internal review procedures."

A six month period, from the time the agency completes the ICR to OMB approval, is fairly common for planning purposes but varies considerably across agencies depending on internal review procedures. Thus, starting the process early can be very important to ensure timely data collection. Survey managers should consult with their agency paperwork clearance officers to ascertain what they need to do and the time required to meet agency and OMB requirements. In rare instances, the PRA does provide for expedited processing if an agency can justify an Emergency Collection (see question #9). 4. When should agencies talk to OMB about plans for a study? The PRA and its implementing regulations provide a formal basis for OMB review of agency information collection requests. However, they do not preclude informal consultation with OMB desk officers prior to the submission of an ICR. Consultation with OMB prior to submission of an ICR is not required as part of the PRA and typically does not occur. However, if an agency is proposing a significant new collection about which it expects OMB may have questions or concerns, the agency is encouraged to consult with its OMB desk officer about the particular 1 5 C.F.R. § 1320.8(d)(1) 2 5 C.F.R. § 1320.10(a) 3"

When an agency is planning a new, large survey data collection, a major revision to an ongoing survey, or large-scale experiments or tests, agencies and OMB frequently find it helpful for the agency to brief OMB on the nature of the planned collection and the proposed methodology. In this less formal context, OMB and agency staff can discuss potential areas of concern, including the need for further detail and justification. This kind of early consultation can considerably reduce the likelihood that major unexpected concerns about survey methodology or statistical sample design will arise during OMB review, and it allows more time for the agency to consider alternatives if necessary. Agencies can then address any issues identified by OMB in their ICRs. While this informal consultation does not affect the timing of the formal OMB review process under the PRA, it can be of benefit in identifying some issues much earlier and may avoid delays that could otherwise occur. 5. What does it mean for an agency to conduct or sponsor an information collection?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,8,"5. What does it mean for an agency to conduct or sponsor an information collection? An agency conducts or sponsors an information collection if the agency collects the information using its own staff and resources, or causes another agency or entity to collect the information, or enters into a contract or cooperative agreement with another person or contractor to obtain the information.3 If the agency requests the collection directly or indirectly through another entity or contractor or exercises control over those collecting the information, the agency is conducting or sponsoring the collection (see also question #6). 6. When are studies involving third party or investigator-initiated grants subject to PRA review? Collections of information conducted through investigator-initiated grants (e.g., in response to a Request for Applications (RFA)) are generally not subject to OMB review under the PRA. However, information collections by a Federal grant recipient are subject to PRA review if (1) the grant recipient is conducting the collection at the specific request of the agency, or (2) the terms and conditions of the grant require specific approval by the agency for the collection or collection procedures.4 If either of these conditions is met, the sponsoring agency needs to seek and obtain OMB approval, and the grantee needs to display the OMB control number on the collection instrument. For example, the National Science Foundation has many program areas that support basic research on a wide variety of topics."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,8,"If either of these conditions is met, the sponsoring agency needs to seek and obtain OMB approval, and the grantee needs to display the OMB control number on the collection instrument. For example, the National Science Foundation has many program areas that support basic research on a wide variety of topics. Proposals are reviewed by scientific panels and funding may be provided to a university researcher to study some topic, which may include a survey. Although the National Science Foundation funded the research, it did not specifically request the survey, nor does the agency approve the collection or the collection procedures. However, if another agency gives the same researcher a grant to design and conduct a survey that the agency reviews and approves, then this collection would be covered by the PRA. Agencies are encouraged to discuss specific cases with their OMB desk officers prior to collecting the information to determine whether the collection is subject to OMB review under the PRA. 3 5 C.F.R. § 1320.3(d) 4 5 C.F.R. § 1320.3(d) 4 Submission of ICRs ­ 7. Are focus groups subject to PRA review? There is no exemption for focus groups in the PRA."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,9,"Are focus groups subject to PRA review? There is no exemption for focus groups in the PRA. Agencies conducting focus groups must comply with the requirements detailed in 5 C.F.R. § 1320.3(c): “Collection of information means…the obtaining…of information by or for an agency by means of identical questions posed to, or identical reporting, record-keeping, or disclosure requirements imposed on, ten or more persons….” It then goes on to clarify “ten or more persons refers to the persons to whom a collection of information is addressed by the agency within any 12 month period.” Thus, focus groups are covered unless the total number of persons participating within a 12-month period is fewer than ten. For example, an agency conducting three focus groups of nine persons would be subject to the PRA because the total number of participants is greater than 10. Although each focus group may not be asked the exact same questions in the same order, focus groups should be treated as information collections under the PRA if the same information is being sought from the groups. For example, an agency that is developing questions for a survey may convene a few focus groups in different areas of the country (or composed of people with different characteristics) and may have fairly wide ranging discussions on the topic of the survey in order to hear how the participants think about that topic and the vocabulary they use. Because the flow of discussion in the different groups may lead to different areas in more depth or at different points in the discussion, some parts of the protocol may not have been necessarily followed verbatim or may have occurred at a different point in one focus group than another. However, the same information was still being sought by the agency and the collection is subject to the PRA, regardless of whether the exact questions or probes were used or used in the exact same order with each group."

However, the same information was still being sought by the agency and the collection is subject to the PRA, regardless of whether the exact questions or probes were used or used in the exact same order with each group. When agencies submit their ICRs for focus groups to OMB, they should include the protocols or scripts for the discussion. Agencies that routinely conduct focus groups as part of their development of questionnaires (e.g., pretesting) may find it useful to obtain a generic clearance for focus groups (see questions #8, #50, #51). In addition to using focus groups for pretesting, an agency may conduct focus groups as part of its collection of other information and in conjunction with other methods of data collection as part of an overall research study. For example, some program participants may participate in a focus group as part of a program evaluation that also includes other collections, such as surveys of program administrators and staff. In these cases, it is important that the focus groups are included and described in the ICR in the context of the collection the agency is conducting so that OMB can appropriately evaluate the entire scope of the study and the practical utility of the information the agency will obtain. Thus, agencies should include the respondent burden associated with the focus groups in the ICR along with the protocols or script for the focus groups. 5 Submission of ICRs ­ 8. What are generic clearances and when are these useful for agencies?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,10,"Submission of ICRs ­ 8. What are generic clearances and when are these useful for agencies? A generic clearance is a plan for conducting more than one collection of information using very similar methods. The review of this plan occurs in two stages: (1) a full PRA review of the generic clearance ICR, which includes the general approach and methodology, at least once every three years, and (2) an expedited review of the individual collections that fall within the scope of the generic clearance. A generic clearance is considered only when the agency is able to demonstrate that there is a need for multiple, similar collections, but that the specifics of each collection cannot be determined until shortly before the data are to be collected. Collections that are appropriate for consideration as generic include methodological tests, focus groups, or other pretesting activities (see question #51), as well as many customer satisfaction surveys. For example, an agency may want to use a “core” satisfaction survey with its many customer groups, but may want to customize the questionnaire for different groups by including some specific questions related to a particular service or publication they use. Each collection under the generic clearance must be well defined in the overarching ICR approved by OMB in terms of its sample or respondent pool and research methodology, and each individual collection should clearly fit within the overall plan. Individual collections should not raise any substantive or policy issues or go beyond the methods specified in the generic ICR. Any individual collection that would require policy or methodological review is inappropriate for expedited review under the generic clearance and must go through the full PRA process."

Any individual collection that would require policy or methodological review is inappropriate for expedited review under the generic clearance and must go through the full PRA process. For example, a generic clearance is not appropriate for the collection of influential information (see question #18) and is probably not appropriate for large collections involving many respondents and high respondent burden. Agencies are encouraged to consult with their OMB desk officers before developing a generic clearance to determine whether their plans are appropriate for this type of clearance. 9. What needs to be done for an emergency clearance? Agencies may submit an emergency ICR if the collection is both needed sooner than would be possible using normal procedures and is essential for the agency’s mission. In addition, the agency must demonstrate that the time to comply with the public comment provisions of the PRA would do any of the following: (1) result in public harm; (2) prevent the agency from responding to an unanticipated event; (3) prevent or disrupt the collection; or (4) cause the agency to miss a statutory or court-ordered deadline. This type of clearance should only be sought if the agency could not have reasonably foreseen the circumstances requiring collection; it is not a substitute for inadequate planning. Agencies submitting an emergency ICR must publish a Federal Register notice stating the collection is being reviewed under emergency processing procedures unless OMB waives this publication requirement."

Approval for an emergency collection is valid for a maximum of six months. If longer approval is needed, the agency must also initiate the normal PRA approval 6 Submission of ICRs ­ process to take effect when the emergency clearance expires. Agencies are strongly encouraged to consult with their OMB desk officers prior to submitting a request for emergency clearance. 10. When do agencies need to complete Part B of the ICR Supporting Statement?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,11,"10. When do agencies need to complete Part B of the ICR Supporting Statement? Agencies are instructed to complete Part B if they are using statistical methods, such as sampling, imputation, or other statistical estimation techniques; most research collections or program evaluations should also complete Part B.5 If an agency is planning to conduct a sample survey as part of its information collection, Part B of the ICR supporting statement must be completed, and an agency should also complete relevant portions of Part B when conducting a census survey (collections that are sent to the entire universe or population under study). For example, an agency doing a census of a small, well-defined population may not need to describe sampling procedures requested in Part B, but it should address what pretesting has taken place, what its data collection procedures are, how it will maximize response rates, and how it will deal with missing unit and item data. Agencies conducting qualitative research studies or program evaluations, including case studies or focus groups, should also complete the relevant sections of Part B to provide a more complete description of the use of the information and the methods for collecting the information (see question #11). 11. Why do agencies need to complete some of Part B if they are conducting qualitative research studies or program evaluations? Agencies need to specify how they plan to use the information they are collecting and how they will collect the information in order for OMB to properly evaluate an ICR that uses qualitative methods. There are elements of Part B that are not covered elsewhere in the justification that agencies should answer to appropriately describe the information collection. For example, an agency conducting case studies should specify in Part B: • how the different sites and/or respondents will be selected, • whether the agency intends to generalize beyond the specific sites and/or respondents selected, • what pretesting has been done, and • what different methods will be used to collect the information, e.g., in-person interviews, focus groups, observations, etc. and the protocols that will be followed to ensure high quality data are obtained."

pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,13,"Scope SCOPE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTION This section addresses questions related to the content of the Information Collection Requests (ICRs) submitted to OMB. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to demonstrate the practical utility of the information that they propose to collect and to balance this against the burden imposed on the public. Thus, it is critical that agencies describe the need for the information and how it will be used. Without a clear justification, OMB cannot approve the collection. The burden on the public must also be completely accounted for and minimized to the extent practicable while still yielding useful information. Again, agencies should consult the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 C.F.R. § 1320) for more detailed and complete information. 12. Why is this data collection necessary and how will the information be used? The PRA requires that agencies address how the information the agency is proposing to collect is necessary for the performance of the functions of the agency. First, agencies should identify legal or administrative requirements that authorize the collection and should include copies of the authorizing statute and regulations in their ICRs."

First, agencies should identify legal or administrative requirements that authorize the collection and should include copies of the authorizing statute and regulations in their ICRs. Second, agencies must also justify why the information is needed and how it furthers the agency’s goals. When appropriate, agencies should also highlight the knowledge gaps that the information collection is designed to address, including a brief review of existing information and the relevant scientific literature. If an agency proposes a research study or program evaluation that is designed to address specific research questions, it must demonstrate a direct connection between the information needs and the specific research questions. Thus, agencies should provide sufficient background information to support the need for the research questions (including a brief review of the relevant scientific literature) and how the study will meet that need. Agencies must also ensure that the collection does not duplicate other information accessible to the agency (but see question #47). If the information is a continuation of a prior collection, agencies should document how the information has been used and the continuing need for the collection. The PRA also requires that the agency demonstrate the practical utility of the collection and the use the agency will make of the information. The supporting statement should always include a careful discussion of what the agency hopes to achieve by collecting the information and the quality of information that will be obtained employing the proposed design."

Agencies must also evaluate their intended use of information from the proposed collection in light of the OMB’s information quality guidelines for utility, integrity, and objectivity6 as well as the agency’s information quality guidelines. Based on that evaluation, agencies should be able to state in their ICRs that the proposed collection of information will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with the OMB and agency information quality guidelines (also see question #18). 6 Guidelines for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by Federal agencies, 67 FR 8452-8460 9 Scope 13. How often should data be collected? When submitting an information collection request (ICR) to OMB, agencies are required to describe the consequences of collecting data less frequently than proposed. While less frequent data collection reduces burden on the public, more frequent data collection can provide more current and useful information. For example, in longitudinal and panel surveys, more frequent collections allow for shorter reference periods between reports, which may reduce bias."

For example, in longitudinal and panel surveys, more frequent collections allow for shorter reference periods between reports, which may reduce bias. The goal is to strike a balance between the need for current information and the need to reduce public reporting burden. Most Federal data collections fall into one of two categories: continuing or one-time. Continuing data collections have an established frequency of collection (monthly, quarterly, annually, biannually, etc.). A one-time collection is conducted without the intention of collecting the same information again, or without an established collection pattern. The frequency of data collection is an issue when establishing a new continuing data collection, when renewing a continuing data collection, or when repeating a prior one-time survey. When determining the frequency of data collection, the agency should consider the following: • The timeliness of estimates requires high frequency collections. For example, the monthly unemployment rate is a key economic indicator, and the data must be collected monthly."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,14,"The timeliness of estimates requires high frequency collections. For example, the monthly unemployment rate is a key economic indicator, and the data must be collected monthly. Some collections are required by law to be collected at specific frequencies, e.g., the Decennial Census occurs every 10 years, and the Economic Censuses are conducted every 5 years (for years ending in 2 and 7). • There is a reasonable expectation of significant change in key statistics between collections. For example, an agency may wish to conduct a customer satisfaction survey every year; however, if the agency has not made any changes in its programs, there would be no expectation for change. If the agency has started a new customer relations program, then a repeat of the customer satisfaction survey could be used to measure the effectiveness of that change. Another consideration in evaluating the frequency of a collection is the potential for seasonal variation. The need to capture cyclical patterns might justify either monthly or quarterly collection. •"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,14,"The need to capture cyclical patterns might justify either monthly or quarterly collection. • The frequency of collection has an effect on data quality. For example, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal survey that captures a month- by-month accounting of income and governmental transfers such as Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc. Pretesting of two different collection periods showed significant differences in the data quality between the three-month and six-month time frames, requiring the use of a shorter period. SIPP adopted a four-month time frame for data collection and reference period, which provided nearly the same quality of data as the three-month time frame with a 25 percent reduction in respondent burden. • Reduced frequency would have an adverse impact on agency programs. If an agency program requires data with a specified frequency, the agency needs to detail how the data will be used and how the agency would be hindered by less frequent information. 10"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,14,"10 Scope 14. What is included in the calculation of burden hours? Burden hours are a measure of the time it takes respondents to review instructions, search data sources, complete and review their responses, and transmit or disclose information. Estimating burden for household surveys is typically done by timing the completion of interviews done in previous administrations of the survey or in pretests (using 9 or fewer persons) and developing an average time. Estimating burden for establishment surveys is more complicated because respondents often have to search for information before answering the survey questions. Agencies must first identify all the steps a respondent takes in order to comply with the survey request, and then estimate the time for each step to arrive at a total burden per respondent. The aggregate burden of an ICR is the average burden per respondent multiplied by the number of expected respondents and should be reported in section A.12 of the ICR. 15. For establishment surveys or panel surveys, should burden hours include the original collection of administrative records that may have taken place months or years before? Generally, surveys of business establishments ask a respondent to aggregate and report data that the establishment already has somewhere in files or databases."

Generally, surveys of business establishments ask a respondent to aggregate and report data that the establishment already has somewhere in files or databases. Burden hours for these surveys should include only the time it takes to locate the source data and aggregate them. The estimate should not include the time originally taken to collect information in administrative records that were compiled by the establishment for its own purposes, such as accounting records. For example, there are a variety of reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the equal employment opportunity arena. These reports usually ask for summary demographic and job data on employees, and respondents often obtain the data needed from existing personnel files, records, or databases. Agencies SHOULD NOT count the time involved in the original collection of the demographic data from the employees but SHOULD count the time it takes to access the personnel files, aggregate the requested data, and report the data on the agency form. For panel or longitudinal surveys, agencies SHOULD count the time it takes respondents to begin their participation in a panel in the initial ICR for the recruitment and baseline collection. However, this time SHOULD NOT be counted in subsequent ICRs that concern later collections. Agencies SHOULD count only the hours associated with the collection of information described in the current ICR."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,15,"However, this time SHOULD NOT be counted in subsequent ICRs that concern later collections. Agencies SHOULD count only the hours associated with the collection of information described in the current ICR. For example, the Survey of Income and Program Participation selects respondents to participate in interviews every four months (called waves) for the duration of a panel—usually 3 or 4 years. Each wave has a set of core questions used in all waves and a topical module that differs from one wave to the next. In essence, each wave is treated as a unique survey and the burden associated with answering all the questions in a wave is reported. In this case, the agency SHOULD count the burden of recruitment and the initial collection in the ICR for wave 1; however, the agency SHOULD NOT count the original recruitment of the individual into the survey panel in the ICRs for later waves. 11 Scope 16. Why are agencies required to estimate the burden in terms of both time and costs? The term ""burden"" means the ""time, effort, or financial resources"" the public expends to provide information to or for a Federal agency, or otherwise fulfill statutory or regulatory requirements.7 Currently, agencies separately estimate the ""hour burden"" and ""cost burden"" of each particular information collection in their supporting statements in A.12 and A.13, respectively. This ensures that both types of burden are taken into account."

This ensures that both types of burden are taken into account. Thus, for establishment surveys, in addition to the hour burden for reviewing instructions, searching data sources, completing and reviewing responses, and transmitting or disclosing information, there may also be capital, operation, and maintenance costs associated with generating and maintaining the information. Agencies should include costs that respondents incur for developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, verifying, processing, maintaining, disclosing, and providing information, as well as costs incurred by respondents adjusting to changes from previous instructions, and training personnel to be able to respond to a collection. These costs may be borne directly by the respondent or indirectly by their subordinates, agents, or contractors. The PRA requires that the agency demonstrate the practical utility of the collection and demonstrate that the burden of the collection both in terms of hours and other costs is justified given the agency’s need for the information and the use the agency will make of the information.

One can often find entire textbooks devoted to one or more methods; thus, the purpose of this section is simply to call attention to some basic considerations agencies should explain and justify in their ICRs when proposing to conduct studies that use these methods. The method selected must also be appropriate for the intended use of the information. Agencies should consult with experts in the particular methods to design and implement their studies. 17. How does the choice of methods for the study relate to the research questions or purpose of the collection?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,17,"17. How does the choice of methods for the study relate to the research questions or purpose of the collection? The methodology for the study should be driven by the kinds of questions the agency needs to answer or the general purpose of the collection. Sometimes agencies collect information for general statistical purposes that may be used by a wide variety of different parties to address many different questions. In this case, the design of the survey or study should reflect these multiple uses and be clear about its strengths and limitations for different purposes, and agencies should consult with appropriate stakeholders and experts when designing their studies to ensure the relevant questions are addressed. In other cases, agencies need to answer very specific questions, and the design needs to be appropriately focused to answer those questions well. Agencies should carefully consider the kinds of questions the information collection needs to answer and the strengths and limitations of different methods to answer those questions. For example, if an agency wishes to know whether a program caused some change to occur in those served by the program, appropriate methods, such as an experimental design, will need to be employed. In this case, agencies will need to do considerable advance planning to randomly assign participants to experimental or control conditions to evaluate the program. If an experimental design is not possible or practical, then a quasi-experimental design or other design may be used by the agency."

Agencies need to justify how their choice of methdology will be able to provide the information needed to address the research question and discuss the limitations as well as the strengths of the methodology for the particular purpose (see question #26). In order to address complex and multi-faceted research questions, an agency may need to plan a program of research and use multi-method approaches to obtain all the information needed. When more than a single study is planned to address the research questions, the agency should include a brief description of the complete research program (including studies not yet approved) in its ICRs and refer to previously approved collections (by their OMB number) to explain how the study fits into the larger program and support how the complete program will provide the agency with the information it needs. If the agency is supplementing its survey collection with administrative or other available data, this should also be described. In addition, the general timeframe for the other components should be included. 13 Choice of Methods 18. How do the use of the information and choice of methods for the study relate to the agency’s information quality guidelines? A primary consideration for an agency in designing its information collections should be how the agency intends to use the information it is gathering."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,18,"How do the use of the information and choice of methods for the study relate to the agency’s information quality guidelines? A primary consideration for an agency in designing its information collections should be how the agency intends to use the information it is gathering. Agencies use information collected through surveys for a variety of purposes. Some information is intended to be “influential information.” As defined in OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines, “influential” means that “an agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.” The Information Quality Guidelines require that agencies hold the information they designate as “influential” to a higher standard of reproducibility and transparency than information that is not defined as influential. For example, some survey results directly or indirectly feed into Principal Federal Economic Indicators that are widely watched and have broad impact on government, business, and individual decisions. In other situations, one agency may use the information collected by another agency to support health and safety assessments that in turn affect both public and private sector decisions. As part of their ICRs, agencies report how they intend to use the information they are proposing to gather. Agencies should explain how the methods they have chosen to employ will yield information of sufficient quality for its intended purpose."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,18,"As part of their ICRs, agencies report how they intend to use the information they are proposing to gather. Agencies should explain how the methods they have chosen to employ will yield information of sufficient quality for its intended purpose. For example, if an agency wishes to generalize the results of a survey beyond the particular cases sampled, it must utilize appropriate statistical sampling methods (see question #30) to yield information that has sufficient precision and accuracy (see question #33). Because more rigorous methods often entail higher cost, agencies need to carefully consider the resources that will be required to obtain information of sufficient quality for the intended uses. Agencies should be able to certify explicitly in their ICRs that the proposed collection of information will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with the OMB and agency information quality guidelines, or they should not propose to collect the information. 19. When should agencies consider conducting a survey? When the research question or purpose of the study is to produce descriptive information about a population, agencies should consider conducting a survey. Surveys may be conducted to provide general purpose statistics on the national (or some target) population, or they may be used as part of a research study, experiment, or program evaluation. For example, an evaluation of a federally funded school program may be done by conducting surveys of school principals, teachers, and district administrators to obtain information from each about the implementation or results of the program."

For example, an evaluation of a federally funded school program may be done by conducting surveys of school principals, teachers, and district administrators to obtain information from each about the implementation or results of the program. However, surveys are often only one source of information that an agency may need, especially when conducting program evaluations. Agencies should also examine how they can obtain other appropriate outcome measures, including the use of administrative records. When properly done with an appropriate sample design, a survey can provide broad descriptive information about a population and subgroups, as well as information about relationships among variables or constructs that are being measured. Generally, the results from surveys are only 14 Choice of Methods descriptive or correlational. When surveys are used in the context of an experimental design, quasi-experimental design, or longitudinal study, stronger causal inferences may be warranted; however, agencies will need to carefully consider the limitations of the study and other potential explanations when drawing causal conclusions. Because they are designed to gather standardized information from an often relatively large number of persons or entities, surveys may not be able to provide the degree of detail that can be obtained through qualitative or case study methods. Furthermore, the standardization of questions requires that the concepts that are being measured be well known and understood, and shown to be reliable and valid."

Furthermore, the standardization of questions requires that the concepts that are being measured be well known and understood, and shown to be reliable and valid. Thus, it may be premature to conduct a survey when an agency is in a more exploratory mode, trying to develop research questions, or understand the characteristics that need to be measured. It is not appropriate for agencies to conduct developmental activities to define a concept and then attempt to use those same findings to test hypotheses (see question #21). A separate survey is needed to test the hypothesis. 20. What should agencies consider when designing and conducting a survey? The quality of a survey design can be judged by the strategies that are taken to prevent, adjust for, and measure potential problems and sources of error in surveys. How well a survey is designed and conducted can lead to either more or less variance (or noise) or bias (or systematic errors) in results. Well-designed and conducted surveys anticipate potential problems and try to prevent or minimize the impact of different sources of error as much as possible."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,19,"How well a survey is designed and conducted can lead to either more or less variance (or noise) or bias (or systematic errors) in results. Well-designed and conducted surveys anticipate potential problems and try to prevent or minimize the impact of different sources of error as much as possible. Additionally, good surveys make efforts to measure and adjust for errors that are not controlled. The best surveys are those that check and verify each step of the research process. Common sources of error in surveys include sampling (due to measuring only a subset of the population), coverage (due to mismatches between the population and the lists used to draw the sample), nonresponse (due to failure to measure some sampled units), measurement (due to mismatches between data sought and data provided), and processing (due to editing or imputation). These topics are dealt with in greater detail in the following sections of this guidance. For example, measurement errors can be reduced through careful questionnaire design and pretesting (see Questionnaire Design and Development). A field test comparing alternative versions (or revised versions) of key questions may provide insights into sensitivity of answers to alternative wording (see questions #22, #23, and #49). Agencies can also reinterview a subsample of respondents to measure instability in responses. Sometimes, survey results can also be checked against administrative records; however, there may be differences in definition and coverage between the information available from records and the survey that need to be carefully considered when assessing the results of the comparison."

Sometimes, survey results can also be checked against administrative records; however, there may be differences in definition and coverage between the information available from records and the survey that need to be carefully considered when assessing the results of the comparison. Similarly, potential nonresponse bias can be reduced by following a variety of strategies to maximize response rates or repair imbalances in the respondent pool (see questions #69 and #70). Bias can be measured in special nonresponse bias studies (see question #71) and adjustments can be made to weights to attempt to reduce bias. Agencies designing and conducting surveys need to consider all of the potential sources of errors and plan to adequately prevent, measure, and adjust for them. Conducting a high quality survey 15 Choice of Methods requires careful planning and sufficient resources to yield quality data that have practical utility for the agency. Agencies should carefully document and justify the adequacy of their survey methods in their ICRs. Specifically, agencies should provide information about the target population, the sampling frame used and its coverage of the target population, the design of the sample (including any stratification or clustering), the size of the sample and the precision needed for key estimates, the expected response rate (see question #63), the expected item non­ response rate for critical questions, the exact wording and sequence of questions and other information provided to respondents, data collection methods and procedures, and the training of interviewers (if applicable). In addition, agencies need to take into account what is known about the different sources of error in their analysis and interpretation of the results from the survey."

Agencies should be transparent and report in their ICRs the methods they plan to use, what is known about the different sources of error, and the impact of the errors on the analytic results.8 21. When should agencies consider conducting a qualitative study? An agency may want to consider a qualitative study under a variety of circumstances. In contrast to gathering numerical information or data that can be quantified, a qualitative study uses unstructured interviews, notes, or observations that are typically difficult to quantify. Qualitative studies can be useful for exploratory investigations such as when very little is known about a problem or the implementation of a program. A qualitative study in this case may be a good first step to understanding the scope of a problem or identifying the key issues for more systematic study. A variety of methods may be used in a qualitative study, including focus groups, unstructured interviews, or semi-structured interviews with “experts,” stakeholders, or other participants."

A variety of methods may be used in a qualitative study, including focus groups, unstructured interviews, or semi-structured interviews with “experts,” stakeholders, or other participants. Case studies may also be conducted (see question #24). Typically, these methods attempt to obtain insights through the intensive study of a relatively small number of people, institutions, or establishments. Respondents are usually purposively chosen because of their knowledge, experience, or status. In a qualitative study, typically, different persons or entities may be chosen because they “represent” a particular kind of person or entity, but the sample is usually not representative—in a statistical sense—of any larger population. However, the obtained information may be very useful in generating hypotheses that can be tested more systematically with other methods such as quantitative surveys. Sometimes qualitative studies are done in conjunction with or as a component of a larger quantitative study to obtain further insights or context for the results; however, these qualitative interpretations can be prone to misinterpretation and over- generalization. Although qualitative studies can also be done using statistical sampling (see question #30) and rigorous designs to generalize results, this is rarely done. Agencies should demonstrate how a qualitative study will meet their information needs."

When should agencies conduct a pilot study, pretest, or field test? Agencies should always consider conducting pretests (small trials of the measurement process) or pilot studies (larger trials yielding statistical information) when planning for a new information collection or changing methods and procedures for an ongoing survey. These kinds of tests may provide critical information necessary to ensure the quality of the data and smoothness of operations needed in the full-scale information collection. They can provide essential information to the agency and result in higher data quality than would have been achieved without them and may be the only vehicle for measuring the effects of different changes an agency is considering implementing."

They can provide essential information to the agency and result in higher data quality than would have been achieved without them and may be the only vehicle for measuring the effects of different changes an agency is considering implementing. Thus, agencies will need to weigh the importance and use of pretests against the time and resources needed to conduct them. Pilot studies can be useful when there are a number of issues the agency needs more information about before a full-scale study can be reasonably implemented. A pilot study may help an agency narrow down the research questions or provide rough estimates (and variances) that can be used to guide sample size determinations. An agency may also use a pilot study to examine potential methdological issues and decide upon a strategy for the main study. A pilot test may also be conducted before a large-scale study in order to test and refine the implementation procedures for the full-scale study. Agencies may want to conduct pretests when developing new questionnaires to see how respondents actually answer questions and identify potential data quality problems, such as high item nonresponse rates. Agencies may also conduct pretests to gather data to refine questionnaire items and scales and assess reliability or validity. Sometimes agencies may also use a field test or experiment (a study to compare the effects of two or more procedures or questionnaires) when planning a change in methodology or questions in an ongoing survey."

Sometimes agencies may also use a field test or experiment (a study to compare the effects of two or more procedures or questionnaires) when planning a change in methodology or questions in an ongoing survey. This enables comparisons and often provides quantifiable data to decide among the different methods or questions to use. An agency may further want to consider conducting a field test experiment on a representative sample to measure the effect of the change in methods or questions on resulting estimates. Agencies can request clearance for pretests, pilot studies, or field tests separately or as part of their ICR for the full-scale collection (also see questions #50 and #51). However, in many cases it makes more sense for these to be separate requests, especially when conducting pilot studies for new collections. Agencies are encouraged to discuss whether it is appropriate to submit these studies separately or in combination with the full-scale study with their OMB desk officers prior to submitting the ICR to OMB. 17 Choice of Methods 23. When should agencies consider conducting focus groups or cognitive interviews? Agencies should consider using focus groups or cognitive interviews when planning for a new information collection or when altering questions on an ongoing survey."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,22,"When should agencies consider conducting focus groups or cognitive interviews? Agencies should consider using focus groups or cognitive interviews when planning for a new information collection or when altering questions on an ongoing survey. Developing effective new questions or revising existing questions can be more difficult than most people anticipate, and questions need to be constructed so that respondents can answer them and provide useful data for the agency. Focus groups (groups of 8-12 persons engaged in a semi-structured conversation led by a moderator) can be a useful first step in questionnaire development that can allow an agency to better understand what respondents think about a topic and what terms they use. Agencies can learn the language that respondents use when discussing the topic and as a result integrate more common terms and phrases into the design of survey questions. Focus groups are also often used as part of a case study or in conjunction with a sample survey or program evaluation to gain insights and perspectives on the operation of a program or to provide more detailed information to help illustrate the results from the survey (see question #24). In a cognitive interview, respondents are asked to think aloud as they answer questions and to identify anything that confuses them. Cognitive interviews can be a valuable tool when an agency has developed proposed questions and needs to understand better how respondents interpret them. Respondents are often asked to paraphrase a question so that researchers learn whether a respondent understands the question and interprets it as intended. Good questionnaire development is aided by survey methodologists who are trained in these methods."

Further information on methods for developing questionnaires is provided in the section on Questionnaire Design and Development (questions #45 to #51). 24. When should agencies consider using case study methods? A case study is a research methodology that is widely used in a variety of contexts. One good definition of a case study is: a method for learning about a complex instance, based on a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained by extensive description and analysis of that instance taken as a whole and in its context. (GAO 1990, p. 14) Case studies can be useful when one is dealing with a complex program about which relatively little is known or understood. A case study can thus serve a useful purpose as a preliminary study for the agency to learn some of the characteristics of how the program is implemented or operating or what its possible effects might be."

A case study can thus serve a useful purpose as a preliminary study for the agency to learn some of the characteristics of how the program is implemented or operating or what its possible effects might be. This can be a useful first step in evaluating a program because it leads to the generation of hypotheses about the program and its implementation, as well as a preliminary assessment of how more systematic research can be designed and implemented to evaluate the program. 18 Choice of Methods Case studies can also provide important insights when used in conjunction with other research methods such as sample surveys. For example, an agency may conduct a large representative sample survey of program sites to gain knowledge about their characteristics. A number of sites may also be selected for case studies to help provide additional understanding about the way the program functions or is implemented, and thus illuminate the quantitative results from the survey. These case studies may, for example, include direct observational components that are not feasible in a large scale national study. More specifically, case studies can provide vital insights about how programs are implemented in different local areas. For programs that deliver their services through State and local agencies, the Federal Government often sets general standards regarding administration, evaluation, and funding."

For programs that deliver their services through State and local agencies, the Federal Government often sets general standards regarding administration, evaluation, and funding. Developing a comprehensive picture of how a federally-regulated program is administered, for example, may require site-specific observation and investigation. Data from specific sites can serve several purposes depending on the study design including: • developing explanatory hypotheses on program characteristics and outcomes, which can be tested in future statistical studies; • preparing guidance for field offices on how services may be delivered more effectively; • providing qualitative explanatory information on the range of program characteristics and outcomes, which complement quantitative results obtained through a statistically valid, generalizable study; and • illustrating findings of the main study through real-world examples. 25. What should agencies consider when designing and conducting a case study? There are a number of limitations of the case study method that agencies should consider. In some situations, these limitations can make it difficult to conduct the research. In others, they can make it difficult to generalize the results. Limitations include: • the case study sites are typically not selected in a manner that allows one to generalize to the population under study; • too few sites are typically visited to get a comprehensive or generalizable picture; • results observed at a site may be due to other factors besides the program being studied, and there is often no control group or randomized assignment to the program; • site visits are expensive; they require significant travel and preparation costs; and • data from site visits are often qualitative and anecdotal in nature."

When designing or evaluating a case study, the following questions should be considered: • Who is conducting the case study? The role of the investigator is very prominent in case study methods and the training, experience, and thoroughness of the investigators visiting a site can have a large impact on the quality of the data that are gathered. • How are the sites selected? How sites are chosen will have direct implications for the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn from the research. Although probability methods are essential for generalizable survey samples (see question #30), the small samples that are typically used in case studies cannot usually be meaningfully generalized to any population. However, the results from case studies are typically not intended to describe 19"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,23,"However, the results from case studies are typically not intended to describe 19 Choice of Methods the population in the same way as those from sample surveys. It may be useful to select cases to represent the diversity and important variations of programs that exist. • How well do the protocols or questionnaires elicit the desired information? As much thought and effort should go into the design of questionnaires and protocols for case studies as goes into these instruments when administered to a national sample. Careful attention also needs to be paid to who will be interviewed as part of the case study. Similarly, other sources of information such as observations by researchers, examination of administrative records, and other documentation are often important components of the case study. • Is interviewer bias and interpretation being minimized? If the data are only qualitative, they may be subject to interviewer interpretation and bias."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,24,"• Is interviewer bias and interpretation being minimized? If the data are only qualitative, they may be subject to interviewer interpretation and bias. To the greatest extent possible, guides for onsite visits and data collection as well as instructions for coding and analyzing the data should be developed beforehand. Visiting one or two sites for a pretest is also highly recommended because the actual site visits can reveal the complexity and difficulty of analyzing case study data. • How will the data be analyzed? Some analysis usually needs to take place in real time at the site to resolve discrepancies or take advantage of the multiple perspectives offered by the different investigators on site. Objective data that have been gathered should be quantified and displayed with basic descriptive statistics. It is unlikely that inferential statistics or hypothesis testing could be used unless sample sizes are adequate and sites were selected appropriately to generalize. •"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,24,"It is unlikely that inferential statistics or hypothesis testing could be used unless sample sizes are adequate and sites were selected appropriately to generalize. • What is the relevant comparison group? Case study research may include comparisons between a program site and a “comparable” site that did not have the program. Unless very strict controls are in place, it is difficult to have a true comparison site for most case studies due to the unknown influences of other factors that could affect observed differences between the sites. The differences between sites that cannot be controlled can, however, often be articulated in advance and need to be carefully considered as limitations to comparisons; nonetheless, having a comparison group may provide more information than if there is no comparison group. Alternatively, case study designs may include baseline pre-program measurements of persons and post-program measurements of the same individuals. 26. When should agencies consider using experimental and quasi-experimental designs? When agency research questions involve trying to determine whether there is a causal relationship between two variables or whether a program caused a change for participants, then agencies will need to employ an experimental or quasi-experimental design or demonstrate how their study design will allow them to determine causality."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,24,"When should agencies consider using experimental and quasi-experimental designs? When agency research questions involve trying to determine whether there is a causal relationship between two variables or whether a program caused a change for participants, then agencies will need to employ an experimental or quasi-experimental design or demonstrate how their study design will allow them to determine causality. Even well conducted experimental and quasi-experimental designs may have limitations or alternative explanations for the results that the agency will need to carefully consider in designing the study and drawing conclusions from the results. For example, it can often be difficult to identify appropriate comparison groups to evaluate the impact of Federal programs or interventions. If an agency wishes to evaluate a new education program that provided some districts or schools with competetive grants to implement the 20 Choice of Methods program, it can be difficult to identify similar districts that are an appropriate comparison to gauge the effects of the program on student outcomes. If the comparison schools or districts differed systematically from those that received program funding then it is not clear whether any differences in student outcomes are due to the program or to the preexisting differences such as urbanicity or poverty level. In addition, sometimes, schools or districts that win (or even apply for) competetive grants may be more interested, motivated, or have greater capabilities for improving student outcomes than schools or districts that don’t win (or apply) for the program grants, and the student outcomes may reflect the underlying motivation or capabilities rather than anything about the program itself. Thus, the agency needs to consider appropriate methods to select comparison schools or districts that will rule out or minimize alternative explanations for differences in student outcomes in order to maximize the value of the program evaluation.

pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,25,"Thus, the agency needs to consider appropriate methods to select comparison schools or districts that will rule out or minimize alternative explanations for differences in student outcomes in order to maximize the value of the program evaluation. One of the key characteristics of experimental designs is random assignment of persons or entities to treatment (or experimental) and control (or comparison) conditions. For example, participants in the treatment condition may receive benefits or services from a Federal program, while participants in the control condition do not. This random assignment of persons to conditions acts to equalize preexisting differences between the two groups so that differences observed between the groups can be attributed to the differences in the Federal program. If random assignment is not strictly possible, then quasi-experimental designs can be employed. These designs rely on identifying appropriate comparison groups and frequently take measurements at two or more points in time in order to rule out or reduce threats to the validity of the conclusions or alternative explanations for differences between the experimental and comparison groups. Different kinds of experimental designs may be used by an agency depending on the research questions or the types of decisions the agency intends to make based on the results. Sometimes the goal may be simply to assess whether a new demonstration program is having the intended effect, before investing additional resources to expand the program and study it further. In this case, it may be possible for an agency to justify using a sample that is not nationally representative or even representative of potential program members. In other cases, the agency may want to estimate the size of the effect a specific intervention would have if implemented throughout the country or evaluate the effectiveness of an ongoing program."

In other cases, the agency may want to estimate the size of the effect a specific intervention would have if implemented throughout the country or evaluate the effectiveness of an ongoing program. In these circumstances, the agency would need a representative sample of program participants in order to accurately describe the population and generalize the results to the rest of the country or to all program sites (see section on Sampling). Agencies need to consider the difficulties of implementing experimental designs and guard against potential threats to the internal validity of the design through choice of appropriate comparison groups and/or conducting multiple measurements over time. It is key that agencies design and implement programs in ways that they can be meaningfully evaluated. For example, conducting an experimental study requires advance planning so that participants can be assigned to conditions. Agencies should justify that the design they have chosen is practical to conduct and will provide the information they need to answer the agency’s research questions. Agencies also need to acknowledge the limitations of their design and to identify clearly how they intend to generalize the results of experimental studies, especially if a representative sample is not proposed. 21"

What is the difference between a census and a sample survey and when is each appropriate? A study where all target population members are asked to participate is often called a universe survey or a census. In contrast, a sample survey is a survey where only a portion of the population of interest is included in the study; that is, only a selected number of households (or businesses) are asked to participate rather than including all members of the population. Furthermore, the members of the target population must be selected with a known probability of selection from a sampling frame that contains all (or nearly all) of the members of the target population. When the target population is small and each unit is unique, a census is likely to be preferred over a sample survey. For example, when an agency evaluates a Federal program that is implemented by the states (each one perhaps somewhat differently), a census of state program directors may provide higher quality information with little cost difference from a sample survey of a slightly smaller number of states. In this case, there may also be concerns about missing practices of some states that were not included in the sample if a census were not conducted. Sample surveys are useful when it is not possible or desirable to collect data from every single member of the population of interest due to reasons such as respondent burden, cost, and operational feasibility."

Sample surveys are useful when it is not possible or desirable to collect data from every single member of the population of interest due to reasons such as respondent burden, cost, and operational feasibility. Often it would be simply too burdensome, expensive, or logistically impractical to collect data from every single unit of the target population. Agencies should consider collecting data from a sample and trying to ensure a high response rate from the sampled units. For a given budget, an agency can devote more resources to quality control activities such as callbacks to nonrespondents and data editing for a sample survey than would be possible with a census, and the results from the sample survey should be more representative and provide less biased estimates of the population than a poorly conducted census. Agencies should carefully consider the benefits and costs of conducting a sample survey versus a census. When the data must be representative of the target population, carefully designed samples can be used to ensure data quality in a way that is often more economical and efficient than a census. Agencies need to justify in Part B of their ICRs their decision to conduct a census instead of a sample survey. 23 Sampling 28. What is a sampling frame and what is the coverage of the sampling frame?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,28,"Sampling 28. What is a sampling frame and what is the coverage of the sampling frame? A sampling frame is a list or set of procedures for identifying all elements of a target population. In theory, the sampling frame should include everyone in the target population as well as other information that will be used in the sampling process or can be used to assess the representativeness of the sample. There are different types of sampling frames, e.g., area and list frames. In an area frame, geographic areas are defined, listed, and then sampled. Often, lists of elements (e.g., housing units) are constructed within the sampled areas and then elements are selected from the lists. In a list frame, a list of all the population elements is used to select the sample directly. Sampling frames also may include information on characteristics of the elements, such as employment levels for a business or enrollment for schools. Sampling frames should be up to date and accurate."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,28,"Sampling frames also may include information on characteristics of the elements, such as employment levels for a business or enrollment for schools. Sampling frames should be up to date and accurate. The coverage of the sampling frame refers to how well the frame matches the target population. For example, approximately 97 percent of U.S. households have land-based telephone lines; therefore, a frame of all residential telephone numbers would have a national coverage rate of 97 percent.9 However, there are systematic differences between households with and without telephones, so that telephone coverage rates for some target populations such as the poor, young adults, and racial or ethnic minorities are often much lower and may not be adequate for some purposes. When those subgroups differ from others on key survey variables, coverage error in the survey estimates can result. The coverage of a sampling frame can change over time and, therefore, it needs to be kept current and accurate. A list of business establishments that is two or three years old will not include any new businesses formed in the past two to three years but will include establishments that have gone out of business, and also may have incorrect contact information for those that have relocated. The availability and accuracy of contact information for sample units within the frame may affect the agency’s choice of mode of data collection. In addition, the availability and accuracy of information for stratification is also an important consideration for choosing a frame. Agencies need to consider the adequacy of potential sampling frames for their target population and should justify in Part B of their ICRs the frame they have chosen for their collection, its coverage, the mechanism for updating, how recently it has been updated, and what is done to assess or adjust for potential coverage errors."

Is a list of Internet subscribers available and acceptable for use as a sampling frame? There currently are no unduplicated lists of Internet users from which to draw a probability sample (see question #30). In other words, there is no sampling frame available for Internet users or those with Internet access. Furthermore, unlike telephone numbers, there is no set format for e-mail addresses that could be used to generate meaningful addresses to construct a sampling frame for those addresses. Currently, lists of e-mail addresses that are commercially available tend to have unknown coverage for most target populations or consist of persons who 9 Blumberg, S., Cynamon, M, Lake, J., & Frankel, M.

Paper presented at the Second International Conference on Telephone Survey Methodology, Miami, Florida. 24 Sampling have self-selected or volunteered to participate in studies; thus, these lists represent convenience samples (see question #35). Recent estimates are that more than 50 percent of households have Internet access at home.10 Despite the increasing rate of Internet access in the U.S., there remain systematic differences in socio-demographic characteristics between those who have access to the Internet at home and those who do not. Thus, there are significant coverage errors in any sampling frame composed only of those who have access to the Internet, which could lead to biased estimates when generalizing to the national population.11 In some cases, an agency may have e-mail addresses from its list frame for the target population that could be used for a census or sample survey. For example, administrative records of program participants may include a variety of means of contacting participants including their e­ mail addresses. In this case, the coverage of the sampling frame is based on the characteristics of the frame the agency has and the specific target population; it does not use or require an Internet sampling frame. The limitations for coverage and sampling of current lists of Internet users means that agencies should consider using any Internet sampling frame only for exploratory purposes, such as part of a pretest (if the main study will have a response option via the Internet), or in other instances where a convenience sample would be appropriate (see question #35). However, these limitations of the Internet for sampling do not imply that the Internet cannot be used as one mode of collecting survey data in a mixed-mode collection (see Modes of Collection), but rather that it is not suitable for drawing a probability sample that can be generalized to a target population."

Using the Internet simply as a mode of data collection, rather than as a sampling frame, is further addressed in question #43. 30. What is an appropriate sample design to ensure the sample drawn represents the population of interest? When a subset of the population is chosen randomly such that each unit has a known nonzero probability of selection, the sample is called a probability sample. For the purpose of making estimates with measurable sampling error that represent a population, the sample must be selected using probability methods (however, also see question #31 for a discussion of cut-off samples that are able to measure estimation error). These methods require that each case in the population has some known nonzero probability of being included in the sample. For example, an agency can randomly select a sample of 500 customers from a complete list of 10,000 customers by drawing their names out of a hat."

Although SRS is rarely used in practice, there are other probability methods that may involve stratifying and/or clustering the sample or involve unequal probabilities of selection (e.g., a design that intentionally oversamples minorities or includes with certainty large businesses that account for a high volume) that are often used in the design of Federal surveys (see question #32). As long as there is a probability mechanism used in selecting the cases (and every unit is given a nonzero chance of selection), samples constructed in this manner can allow the agency to estimate the characteristics of the population from which they were drawn with a known level of sampling error. Non-probability samples do not have this property. When selecting a sample design, agencies need to consider how the information will be used and what generalizations are intended, and agencies need to explain in their ICRs how they will generalize the results of a survey. Agencies must have a statistical basis for generalizing the results beyond the particular sample selected and need to consult a sampling statistician in designing their sample for their survey. Agencies conducting surveys that are intended to produce valid and reliable results that can be generalized to the universe of study, but are not based on probability methods, must clearly justify the statistical methodology (e.g., see question #31) in Part B of the ICR. Otherwise, OMB cannot approve the collection.12 31. Are probability samples always the best for surveys of establishments?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,30,"Otherwise, OMB cannot approve the collection.12 31. Are probability samples always the best for surveys of establishments? Although a probability sample drawn from the general population is the best way to represent a population of individuals or households, it can be more efficacious to employ other sampling methods, such as cut-off samples, when the target population is businesses or other highly skewed populations. Cut-off samples are selected by ordering the universe of potential respondents by some important characteristic and selecting the units with the greatest amount of the characteristic until some specified percentage of the universe is included in the sample. A rule of thumb often used for cut-off samples is that the sample should cover 80 percent of the population total. This method gives an achieved sample that provides the minimum mean square error estimate for the total value of the variable used to specify the coverage. For highly skewed populations, such as those found in some establishment surveys, this method also provides the smallest possible sample. For example, an agency conducting a study of capital expenditures of manufacturers may “cut off” when the survey has received data from establishments with more than 80 percent of the revenues of the universe. Since the cutoff rule is based generally on estimates from a prior time period, the success of the cutoff rule is dependent on the level of stability in the estimates over time. In conjunction with a ratio based on a recent census survey of the population, this method is efficient, reduces respondent burden, and works well for estimating totals."

In conjunction with a ratio based on a recent census survey of the population, this method is efficient, reduces respondent burden, and works well for estimating totals. However, it can be misleading if detail is needed on the smaller units, because they are more likely to be excluded from the sample. Cut-off or other model-based samples are used for some economic surveys conducted by Federal agencies. Designing and using these samples requires that agencies have considerable information about the target population and statistical expertise in order to achieve estimates with smaller errors and biases than would be possible with a probability sample of the same size. 12 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(d)(2)(v). 26 Sampling When the goal of the collection is to make an estimate for a target population, agencies need to provide a statistical justification in the ICR for using cut-off or other model-based samples that demonstrates that estimates of precision can be calculated and that the error of the estimates and potential biases are acceptably small. 32. What information should agencies provide about their complex sample designs?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,31,"32. What information should agencies provide about their complex sample designs? Simple random samples (where all units and all equal-numbered combinations of units have the same probabilities of selection) are rare in practice for a number of reasons. Often they are not practical for many information collections because the sheer size of a universe listing and subsequent random sampling may be cost prohibitive. For example, it may be impractical for an agency wishing to survey and administer tests to high school students to select a simple random sample of students because there is not a comprehensive listing of all students in the United States, and even if there were, the costs of administering tests across the many sites where students were sampled could be prohibitive. Thus, other probability-based methods that employ multiple stages of selection, and/or stratification, and/or clustering are used to draw more practical samples that can be generalized with known degrees of sampling error. These samples are referred to as complex sample designs. To properly design and analyze data from these kinds of samples, agencies will need to consult with trained survey statisticians to accurately reflect the statistical effects of the design on the survey estimates. Agencies need to consider tradeoffs between the cost and efficiency of different sample designs for their purpose, and should demonstrate why the particular design they have chosen is appropriate for their research questions and planned uses of the information. In their ICRs agencies should provide a complete description of the proposed sample design including a description of each stage of selection, a description and definition of the strata, including estimates of the size of the universe and the proposed sample by strata."

Any clustering in the sample should also be described. 33. How large should a sample be for a statistical survey? There are a variety of factors that will affect the size of the probability sample that an agency will need for a particular collection in order to obtain the quality of information that is needed. The size of a sample needed for an information collection is affected by a number of different factors including: • degree of precision required--the significance level and confidence levels required for the estimates, and the acceptable margin of error; • variability of the overall population on the key variables being measured; • approximate values of the statistics that will be estimated, especially for proportions; • type of estimate; • sample design, e.g., the stratification and clustering of the sample; • whether overall national estimates are the primary focus or whether estimates will also be made for subgroups—each subgroup must have adequate sample sizes; and 27 Sampling • size of the overall population that estimates will describe. Agencies will need to consult with trained survey statisticians to ensure that the sample size is adequate for its intended purposes. In Part B, agencies need to provide their precision requirements for the estimates they intend to produce from the survey to justify the sample size and the resulting respondent burden."

In Part B, agencies need to provide their precision requirements for the estimates they intend to produce from the survey to justify the sample size and the resulting respondent burden. Although overall national estimates are often the focus of Federal surveys, in many cases what is of greater analytic interest to the agency is either sub­ national estimates or estimates for subgroups, e.g., different industries in an establishment survey or different income or education groups for a demographic survey. The precision requirements for estimates of these subgroups often drive the overall sample size that is needed, and therefore should be clearly documented in Part B of the ICR. For illustrative purposes, Table 1 below provides a very general guide on sample sizes in the special case of a simple random sample and a survey variable that can be expressed as a percentage of the sample. The table provides 95 percent confidence intervals for different estimated percentages from the survey (shown in the first column) with different sample sizes of a simple random sample (shown on the second row across the columns). The size of the 95 percent confidence interval for each combination of survey estimates and sample sizes is shown in the body of the table. For example, if an item on a survey is selected by 50 percent of the respondents and the sample size is 400 respondents, the 95 percent confidence interval for this estimate would be 50 percent plus or minus 5.0 percent, or 45 percent to 55 percent.

Can pre-existing survey panels, such as Internet panels, be used to obtain representative samples? Recently, some private sector firms have developed pre-recruited panels of respondents who respond to surveys on the Internet. These pre-existing panels consist of lists of potential respondents that were recruited from a variety of sources and are maintained for additional survey use. For market research, these panels have become an easy, quick, and inexpensive way to assess consumer preferences. However, use of these panels for Federal surveys that are seeking to generalize to a target population can be problematic."

However, use of these panels for Federal surveys that are seeking to generalize to a target population can be problematic. Often, respondents in these panels are not recruited using probability methods (see question #30), and the panels are typically simply convenience samples of persons interested in taking part in surveys on the Internet (see question #35). Because the sample is not a probability sample where each member of the target population had a known nonzero chance of selection, the results cannot be generalized to any target population using traditional statistical criteria. Some Internet panels have been recruited from a probability-based sampling frame such as a Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sample of telephone numbers, and panel members are given Internet access as part of their participation. In this case, the Internet simply serves as the mode of data collection, not the sampling frame (see question #43). The issues of coverage and quality of the frame apply to whatever frame was used (e.g., RDD), not the Internet. However, there are also concerns about potential self-selection of respondents and low response rates in these panels (see question #72). These panels work well when samples of persons interested in taking part in surveys are needed, and the objective is not to generalize to a specific target population (e.g., pilot studies). Agencies planning to use a pre-existing panel or Internet-based sampling frame need to justify its appropriateness for the intended use of the data in the ICR (see question #72)."

What are some common nonprobability samples, and why are they used? Under some circumstances, agencies may consider using nonprobability or purposive samples. It is not possible to calculate a probability of selection for these kinds of samples; therefore, their use is typically limited to research or exploratory purposes. Agencies need to understand the limitations of these samples and how those limitations will affect the use of data resulting from these samples. Agencies should justify in their ICRs the rationale for choosing a particular nonprobability sample and state how they will use the data. Agencies conducting surveys that were not designed to produce valid and reliable results that can be generalized to the universe of study must clearly explain how the collection is necessary to satisfy a statutory requirement or other substantial need.

Consequently, they are relatively inexpensive, easy to plan, and take a minimal amount of time to draw. Though results cannot be 13 5 C.F.R. § 1320.5(d)(2)(v). 29 Sampling generalized to a target population, convenience samples can be useful for pilot research studies, testing of questionnaires, and some customer satisfaction surveys.

The quota may be defined such that the final numbers of participating units with given characteristics have the same proportion as corresponding units have in the population. While the resulting quota sample may appear to be representative of the population for a set of characteristics, there is still an element of convenience—only those units that were the most ‘available’ become part of the sample. Also, there is no controlling for additional nonrepresentativeness that may exist in the sample for variables not used to define the quotas. Expert choice samples are purposive samples in which an “expert” specifically chooses sample elements with certain characteristics to mimic ‘typical’ or ‘representative’ members of the population. In addition to the inability to determine the probability of selection associated with the sampled cases, this method can also produce entirely different types of samples depending on the opinions of the experts used. Snowball samples are traditionally used to sample rare populations or populations that are hard to locate. A frame or sample for the rare population is created or identified by beginning with a set of units belonging to the target population, and asking this initial set to provide information on other members of this population. These units are then contacted for information that they may have on others in the population. This method of sampling is excellent for building a frame or creating a sample based on informal social networks and is often used for research or investigative purposes."

However, there is no good way to evaluate the coverage of the frame constructed in this manner, and duplications in the frame are not always evident.

Cut-off samples are used for some economic surveys conducted by Federal agencies. See question #31 for further information about justifying the use of cutoff samples.

What are the different modes of survey data collection? The mode of data collection includes the way in which respondents are contacted and how their responses are obtained. The most commonly used data collection modes are in-person (or face­ to-face), telephone, mail, and web (including e-mail). In-person and telephone surveys are typically interviewer-administered, while mail and web surveys are self-administered, though technology is creating new hybrids, such as self-administered telephone surveys using touchtone data entry (TDE) or interactive voice response (IVR). Although mail, telephone, and in-person surveys were traditionally conducted with a paper and pencil questionnaire, many Federal surveys now use some form of computer-assisted interviewing (CAI). Each mode of administration may be computer assisted: Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), and Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (CASI). There are a number of advantages of CAI. It allows for more complex questionnaire designs because CAI instruments can use answers from several questions to direct the interview through different series of questions, skip particular questions, and change question wording based on previous responses."

It allows for more complex questionnaire designs because CAI instruments can use answers from several questions to direct the interview through different series of questions, skip particular questions, and change question wording based on previous responses. Data quality may also be improved by including range and consistency checks into the instrument to help ensure that the correct information is being entered by the respondent or the interviewer. Furthermore, for longitudinal surveys, information provided previously by the respondent may be available to reduce respondent burden and/or improve data quality. Finally, data are usually available quickly and with fewer data entry errors than data from paper instruments that require clerical check-in and keying. There are also disadvantages associated with CAI. CAI instruments often take longer to develop and program than paper instruments and may be costly to pretest and revise. Agencies need to schedule lead time to draft specifications and author the instrument, as well as test and debug the instrument. The time and costs involved in these efforts can be considerable for complex instruments. In addition, interviewers will need training in using the instrument."

Data quality may also be affected by the usability and design of the instrument, so agencies are encouraged to include usability testing as part of their pretesting (see question #22 and #49). 32 Modes of Data Collection 37. What mode of data collection is appropriate for a given survey? Each mode of data collection has inherent advantages and disadvantages, and there is no one best data collection mode for all situations. Selection of the mode requires consideration of many factors. Specifically, agencies should consider the following statistical and nonstatistical issues when selecting a mode of collection: Statistical issues in mode selection • Coverage: Who in the target population may be missed in the sampling frame used for the mode? Because the mode of data collection is often intertwined with the selection or availability of a sampling frame, it has implications for how well the target population will be covered (see question #28)."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,37,"Specifically, agencies should consider the following statistical and nonstatistical issues when selecting a mode of collection: Statistical issues in mode selection • Coverage: Who in the target population may be missed in the sampling frame used for the mode? Because the mode of data collection is often intertwined with the selection or availability of a sampling frame, it has implications for how well the target population will be covered (see question #28). For example, a telephone survey would be inappropriate in terms of coverage for a study of poverty or means-tested programs where a significant portion of the target population does not have a phone or often has phone service interruptions due to nonpayment of bills. • Nonresponse bias: How different are respondents expected to be from nonrespondents? Data collection modes can also affect response rates and nonresponse bias. For example, in-person surveys on average show the highest response rates, and for household surveys, telephone survey response rates have tended to be higher than mail surveys, although recent declines in telephone response rates may remove this advantage. There is also evidence that mail surveys yield higher response rates than web or e-mail surveys. Different data collection modes also have different implications for investigating potential nonresponse bias. For example, the interviewers for in-person surveys can record characteristics of the neighborhood for respondents and nonrespondents allowing a comparison of differences between these groups. •"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,37,"For example, the interviewers for in-person surveys can record characteristics of the neighborhood for respondents and nonrespondents allowing a comparison of differences between these groups. • Measurement error: What factors may affect the quality and completeness of responses? The choice of mode can affect the completeness of data that are collected and the extent to which there are other response effects such as social desirability bias, and response order effects. For example, the presence of an interviewer has been shown to affect reporting of sensitive behaviors such as illicit drug use. Nonstatistical issues in mode selection • Timeliness • Cost The following questions and answers on each mode provide some advantages and disadvantages for each mode of collection in terms of both statistical and nonstatistical issues. For clarity and simplicity, the information in the following questions and answers describes the advantages of each mode when it is the only one used. In practice, multiple modes are frequently used by agencies to overcome specific disadvantages associated with a single mode of collection (see question #38)."

In practice, multiple modes are frequently used by agencies to overcome specific disadvantages associated with a single mode of collection (see question #38).

Agencies must justify their choice of mode of data collection in their ICRs and provide details of their data collection methods in Part B of their supporting statements. 38. When should agencies consider a mixed-mode approach? The two main reasons to consider using more than one mode of collection simultaneously are cost and response rates. The typical mixed mode approach is to use a less costly method for initial contact and a more costly mode for follow-up with nonrespondents, such as using a mail survey with telephone nonresponse follow-up or a telephone survey with an in-person nonresponse follow-up. Using multiple modes often yields a higher response rate by offering alternative means to respond, so respondents may choose the mode that is most convenient for them; for example, some businesses may prefer to respond via the Internet rather than complete a paper questionnaire."

A multimode survey can often be conducted at a lower cost than doing the entire survey using the more expensive mode. However, switching modes for a nonrandom subset of the sample (those who initially did not respond) may also introduce additional variability or bias due to mode effects. Using a mixed mode approach is best applied in situations where the trade- off in the reduction of nonresponse error compensates for any increase in response error related to mode effects. Agencies planning mixed mode collections should carefully design their survey questionnaires to minimize potential mode effects or they should consider conducting experimental studies to assess potential mode effects. 39. How does GPEA affect choice of modes for survey data collection? The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) required agencies by October 21, 2003 to provide for the option of electronic reporting when practicable, and OMB has issued implementation guidance on this law.14 Agencies are increasingly offering either computer- assisted interviewing, fax reporting, or options for filling out a survey on the web. Because many households do not have access to the Internet or computers, electronic reporting options for many household survey information collections will likely lead to more multi-mode surveys rather than replacing telephone or mail surveys completely with electronic collections; however, many business establishments may prefer an electronic option."

What are the advantages and disadvantages of mail surveys? Mail surveys have been particularly useful for mandatory household and establishment surveys. They are most appropriate when there is a good address list for a sampling frame. For example, both the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics have list frames of business establishments (the Census Bureau also has the master address file for households)."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,39,"They are most appropriate when there is a good address list for a sampling frame. For example, both the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics have list frames of business establishments (the Census Bureau also has the master address file for households). Other Federal agencies may have administrative records of their program participants that serve as their sampling frames. Mail surveys have relatively low cost, and self-administration of the questionnaire improves response to sensitive questions, minimizing social desirability and interviewer biases. There is also evidence that question order effects are reduced in mail survey questionnaires. In addition, visual aids can be used with this mode. There are a number of disadvantages of mail surveys. Mail surveys frequently can suffer from low response rates, especially for household surveys; therefore, they are often used in mixed mode surveys (see question #38) with follow-ups done via telephone or in-person. Furthermore, there may be more nonresponse bias in mail surveys because the respondent can look over the entire questionnaire before deciding whether to respond or not, increasing the likelihood that the decision to respond is based on his or her values on the key variables of the survey. Mail surveys require accurate mailing addresses, a longer data collection phase than other modes (usually eight weeks or more are required from the initial mailing), and greater literacy skills on the part of respondents."

Mail surveys require accurate mailing addresses, a longer data collection phase than other modes (usually eight weeks or more are required from the initial mailing), and greater literacy skills on the part of respondents. Household mail surveys should generally have short, less complex questions; however, more complex questions are frequently used in mail surveys of business establishments. It is important that mail questionnaires have clear instructions, easy to follow layouts, and clear question wording because there is no interviewer present to clarify the agency’s intent. The items on mail survey questionnaires are more likely to be incomplete than those on surveys that employ other modes (higher item nonresponse). Mail surveys may be completed by someone other than the sampled person, which can be problematic for household surveys that seek to randomly select one adult from among the household members. In mail surveys of business establishments, gatekeepers can prevent respondents from receiving questionnaires. For example, a secretary or administrative assistant may open all the mail for an office and may routinely throw away voluntary surveys rather than passing them on to the appropriate respondent. 41. What are the advantages and disadvantages of telephone interviewing?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,39,"41. What are the advantages and disadvantages of telephone interviewing? Telephone interviewing can provide lower costs and shorter data collection times compared to in-person interviews. Telephone coverage rates in the United States have been over 90 percent for several decades, and random-digit dialing (RDD) surveys have become very popular for a wide range of social, political, and marketing research. RDD telephone surveys have been very useful for screening large numbers of households to find rare populations. Often telephone surveys are conducted using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) in large, centralized facilities that include careful supervision and monitoring of interviewers. Thus, in CATI calling centers, interviewer variance is likely to be less than for in-person interviews. Social desirability concerns may also be less than is the case for in-person surveys. Some 35"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,39,"Some 35 Modes of Data Collection technology is also being used to reduce further the role of the interviewer and allow self- administered telephone surveys using touchtone data entry (TDE) or interactive voice response (IVR). For example, short, simple surveys that require numeric responses that can be entered on the telephone key pad may be done through touch-tone data entry (TDE), and may not require an interviewer at all. TDE has worked well with ongoing, simple establishment surveys when respondents have been trained to answer this way. There are also disadvantages to telephone interviewing. Although telephone coverage in the United States is very high, some groups, such as those with low incomes, are more likely to be excluded from the sampling frame, thereby introducing bias. Cell phones currently are not covered by existing frames, and there are some legal restrictions on calling these phones (i.e., automated dialers cannot be used). Current estimates of households with only cell phones are still small; for example, a 2004 supplement to the Current Population Survey showed that approximately 6 percent of households had cell phones but no landline phone.15 However, the number of households with only mobile phones is growing and may present further coverage problems for telephone surveys. Increasing use of technologies including answering machines, voice-mail, and caller ID is making it harder to reach households, and RDD telephone survey response rates have been decreasing more rapidly than those of other modes in recent years (see question #70). RDD sampling frames have no information other than the phone number, so vendors are often used to match phone numbers to addresses and other area-level information to make it possible to mail advance letters, do in-person follow-up, or conduct non-response bias analyses (see questions #38, #70, and #71)."

However, match rates for phone numbers to addresses are frequently 50 percent or less when using a single vendor. Conducting an interview over the telephone also imposes more constraints on the length of the questionnaire and complexity of the questions compared to some other modes. For example, the design of telephone surveys usually includes short questions, with a minimum number of response categories, and a relatively short interview length. Some response effects, such as question order and response order, are more likely to occur in telephone surveys than self- administered surveys. For example, respondents are more likely to select the last response option (recency effect) in a telephone survey than a mail survey. There is no ability to use a visual communication medium in telephone surveys (unless materials are mailed in advance), and it is difficult to search records or look up information during a telephone interview. In business establishments and some households, gatekeepers can prevent the interviewer from reaching the desired respondent. For example, a secretary or administrative assistant may screen all calls and not allow access to the appropriate respondent."

Similarly, a spouse or parent may prevent direct access to the sample person. Recent changes in the law related to the portability of telephone numbers are likely to have an increasing impact on telephone surveys and make it more difficult and expensive to conduct them in the short term.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of in-person interviewing? Area probability sampling and in-person interviewing provide the best coverage for household surveys, and are often considered the gold standard. Given adequate time and numbers of contact attempts, in-person interviews typically have the highest response rates. In-person interviews also allow the use of visual tools such as flash cards and calendars, and permit longer, more complex interviews to take place. In addition, the interviewer can make observations about the neighborhood of the household, or in establishment surveys, facility characteristics can be documented. The primary disadvantage of in-person interviews is the high cost associated with sending an interviewer to households or business establishments to collect the data. Also, the data collection phase of the survey may take longer (or require a larger interviewing force) compared to other modes of collection. In-person interviewers may also face barriers in completing their assignments because some sampled addresses may be less accessible to interviewers, e.g., high rise buildings and gated communities, or be in high crime areas with greater risk to interviewer safety."

In-person interviewers may also face barriers in completing their assignments because some sampled addresses may be less accessible to interviewers, e.g., high rise buildings and gated communities, or be in high crime areas with greater risk to interviewer safety. Because in-person interviewers typically operate alone with much less supervision and control than is possible in more centralized telephone facilities, there may be greater interviewer variance in in-person surveys, and there are also greater opportunities for interviewer falsification of some survey items or entire interviews. Survey organizations typically conduct some reinterviews or independent verification of interviewers’ work to detect and minimize falsification. In-person interviews may not be the best mode of data collection when respondents in a business must refer to detailed records that take time to find, or when there are concerns about potential interviewer or social desirability bias. However, technology has been used to address concerns about social desirability with surveys on sensitive topics, such as illicit drug use. Portions of the in-person interview can be completed privately by respondents using an audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) instrument that “reads” the question to the respondent through headphones to increase privacy as well as reduce bias due to literacy or English proficiency problems. Respondents can listen to questions and look at the instrument on a computer screen at the same time and respond in private. Research has demonstrated that respondents report more incidents of drug use, sexual activities, and other sensitive behaviors using this mode of collection, which is presumed to reflect more accurate reporting.16 43.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Internet surveys? To comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), agencies are increasingly offering the opportunity to respond to surveys, especially surveys of business establishments, via electronic means, including the Internet (see question #39). When e-mail addresses are 16 See Turner, C., Forsyth, B., O’Reilly, J., Cooley, P., Smith, T., Rogers, S., and Miller, H.

Like other modes that use computer administration, data processing time and cost may be reduced compared to paper and pencil surveys because data can be uploaded or captured directly into databases without additional keying. Data quality may also be higher because the instrument can contain built-in edits and prompts. However, more complex instruments may be costly to pretest and revise. There are a number of disadvantages to Internet surveys. As noted in question #29, a key problem is that there is no sampling frame of persons or establishments with Internet access or means of randomly generating e-mail addresses to obtain a random sample of users. Low household coverage rates for Internet access as well as systematic differences between households with access and those without access means that using the Internet as the sole mode for population surveys is problematic. If an agency has a high quality sampling frame for its target population and knows the members of the target population have Internet access, then the agency could consider an Internet-only collection. There are other disadvantages or limitations to Internet surveys."

There are other disadvantages or limitations to Internet surveys. Mail surveys (on paper) typically achieve higher response rates than web surveys or e-mail surveys. Respondents need to be “computer literate” and have access to the Internet. Respondents may also have a variety of hardware and software configurations that may cause differences in how they see and interact with the survey. Therefore, usability testing should be an important part of the agency’s development and testing of the questionnaire. Respondents may have concerns about confidentiality and, therefore, be reluctant to provide some information over the Internet. Finally, there is little control or knowledge about whether the selected respondent is the actual survey respondent. 44. How does the data collection mode affect questionnaire design?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,42,"44. How does the data collection mode affect questionnaire design? Each mode of data collection has implications for different issues in questionnaire design, including skip patterns, response options, and question wording. Studies that use multiple modes of collection also need to ensure that the questionnaire can be effectively administered in each mode and any response effects due to the mode of administration are minimized. For example, skip patterns can be programmed easily into a computer assisted interview (CAI) instrument, but only limited skip patterns should be used in paper instruments because errors are more likely to occur when respondents or interviewers are asked to follow skip patterns. Self- administered interviews can have more response options than interviewer-administered interviews (especially telephone surveys) because the respondent can easily go back over the list before selecting a response and can more easily change a response if an inaccurate response has 38 Modes of Data Collection been entered. Also, visual aids cannot be used to help the respondent understand the question or the response options in a telephone interview. Complex and long sentences should generally be avoided in survey questions, but they are particularly difficult to understand over the telephone.

What should agencies do when developing new questionnaires or questionnaire items? Agencies need to use questions that will elicit the appropriate information from respondents to fill the agencies’ data needs. Agencies should determine the different topics, estimated survey length, and mode of survey administration prior to drafting the actual survey questions. Questionnaire designers should inspect other instruments that have collected data on similar topics and must also adhere to OMB classifications and standards for particular data elements, such as data on race and ethnicity, and industry and occupation (see question #47, #52, and #55). If new questions are needed, agencies should use techniques to test the questions that will ensure that the questions they develop provide the information they need and have adequate statistical reliability (see question #48). Agencies should clearly document in their ICRs the source for questions that were taken from other surveys and identify new questions the agency has developed and tested on its own. For ongoing surveys, any changes to the questionnaire should be clearly noted and described."

For ongoing surveys, any changes to the questionnaire should be clearly noted and described. The plan for testing or the results from the testing should also be described in Part B of the ICR. 46. Why should agencies consider using questions previously used by other agencies or researchers? There are many surveys conducted by government agencies or private sector entities that may include questions that will effectively capture some of the data needed by an agency. Questions used in other major surveys are more likely to have known characteristics of reliability and validity, allowing the agency to take advantage of research data collected and analyzed by other agencies. However, the questions may have been asked in a different context or be more detailed than needed. Agencies will need to consider these factors when looking at other agencies’ questions. Agencies with data needs outside their particular subject matter specialty should consult with the statistical agencies that are most likely to collect the type of data needed as well as with agencies with expertise in the area."

Agencies with data needs outside their particular subject matter specialty should consult with the statistical agencies that are most likely to collect the type of data needed as well as with agencies with expertise in the area. For example, if a health survey needs employment data, the agency should collaborate with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Census Bureau, or if an education survey needs disability questions, the agency should consult with the National Center for Health Statistics, the Census Bureau, and the Social Security Administration. Many Federal agencies currently post survey questionnaires on their web sites, which facilitates the sharing of questions. 40 Questionnaire Design Interagency groups are occasionally formed to develop standardized questions on subjects that cut across many agencies. For example, an Interagency Committee on Measures of Educational Attainment has reviewed and recommended a set of standard categories for educational attainment.17 More recently, an interagency committee on the American Community Survey has coordinated across agencies to share needs for information and to test alternative questions.18 On the other hand, asking previously used questions does not mean that the survey requires no pretesting. There is substantial evidence that the context of the question affects its performance; hence, pretesting is always needed. 47. When is it acceptable to duplicate questions used on other surveys? In designing their information collections, agencies are expected to review existing studies to determine whether the information the agency needs exists elsewhere."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,45,"When is it acceptable to duplicate questions used on other surveys? In designing their information collections, agencies are expected to review existing studies to determine whether the information the agency needs exists elsewhere. Agencies are to describe the existing information in their ICRs and show specifically why the information already available cannot be used or modified for use. If the existing information will not fulfill the agency’s needs, the agency should take advantage of the developmental work from existing collections to inform the design of its information collection. Using questions from well-established national data collections such as the Current Population Survey, the Decennial Census, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, or the National Health Interview Survey helps assure comparability of results. Reasons for using the same questions include benchmarking the responses of one survey to another, or obtaining comparable information from a different population or from the same population at a different time period. In their ICRs, agencies should clearly document the source for questions that were taken from other surveys. 48. What techniques can be used to develop new questions?19 Developing effective new questions is often more difficult than most people anticipate, especially if the questionnaire designer is not experienced with survey measurement.

Agencies immersed in a topic are often surprised how little respondents know and care about the topic. Agencies may assume knowledge and points of view that respondents may not have. For example, respondents need to know what the intention of the question is so that they can answer it appropriately, and they may have difficulty understanding questions that use technical or unfamiliar terminology. Questions need to be developed so that respondents can answer the question and provide useful data for the agency. The following survey research methods can be used to develop and pretest new survey questions: 17 Federal Interagency Committee on Measures of Educational Attainment (2000).

Typically, a moderator will guide participants in a focus group discussion on the topics related to the subject area of the survey. Participants are encouraged to talk using their own terms and experiences and react to what others have said. In fact, it is often the interaction among participants that provides the most useful insights. Agencies can learn the language that respondents use when discussing the topic and integrate more common terms and phrases into the design of survey questions. Focus groups often serve as a way to test the ease of completing a self-administered questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire individually, the group discusses the experience with overall direction from the moderator. This provides information about the appearance and formatting of the questionnaire in addition to content problems."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,46,"After completing the questionnaire individually, the group discusses the experience with overall direction from the moderator. This provides information about the appearance and formatting of the questionnaire in addition to content problems. Finally, focus groups can be very effective in the ultimate design of surveys that ask about sensitive topics. Asking sensitive questions in a survey environment can be especially awkward, and discussions among focus group participants can provide useful information on appropriate wording, terms, and phrases that respondents will not find offensive. Pre-Survey Design Visits for Establishment Surveys Visiting a respondent’s place of business to review plans for a new survey or major changes in an existing survey can be very useful in improving the final design of a questionnaire. These visits generally involve discussions with a potential respondent on the following topics: • Does the respondent keep the data that the agency wants? • How closely does the establishment’s record keeping correspond to the required survey data? • How compatible are these record keeping systems with the agency’s collection instruments? • How difficult will it be to provide the data in the time period needed by the agency?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,46,"How compatible are these record keeping systems with the agency’s collection instruments? • How difficult will it be to provide the data in the time period needed by the agency? These visits can help in the preliminary stages of survey development to ensure that the data collectors will design a survey that respondents can complete and that will obtain useful and usable information that corresponds to the agency’s data needs. Cognitive Interviews The goal of cognitive interviews is to gain insight into how respondents think about and interpret the survey questions. In classical cognitive interviews, this is done by asking respondents to think aloud as they answer questions (concurrent think aloud) and to identify anything that confuses them. Respondents are often asked to paraphrase a question so that researchers learn whether a respondent understands the question and interprets it as intended. If the same paraphrased wording is used by several respondents, it might suggest a better wording of the question. Cognitive interviews can also include in-depth retrospective debriefings during which the interviewer asks a series of probes after the completion of the survey. 42"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,46,"Cognitive interviews can also include in-depth retrospective debriefings during which the interviewer asks a series of probes after the completion of the survey. 42 Questionnaire Design A key benefit of using cognitive interview methods is that researchers can quickly diagnose problems, revise question wording to solve problems and conduct additional interviews to see if the new questions are less problematic. The most effective process is to plan iterative rounds, first identifying problems, then making changes to items, and then trying out those changes in successive rounds of cognitive interviews. OMB has issued an addendum to Statistical Policy Directive No. 2, Standards and Guidelines for Cognitive Interviews, available at www.WhiteHouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/directive2/ final_addendum_to_stat_policy_dir_2.pdf. 49. What role does pretesting play in questionnaire development? When an agency has developed new survey questions or is pulling questions from different sources into a new questionnaires, it is important to test how respondents will react to the individual items and the questionnaire as a whole, so a variety of methods are often used to test the questionnaire. In a pilot test, the survey (or some portion of the survey) is administered to a sample of respondents similar to those in the main study using procedures planned for the full survey. Although this is often the only type of testing done prior to data collection, this type of pretest is not beneficial for question development unless there is a respondent and/or interviewer debriefing as part of the process or the data from the pretest are reviewed for questions with high item nonresponse. Pretests may aid in question development by using one or more of the following methods: • respondent debriefing • interviewer debriefing • split panel designs • behavior coding • data reviews Respondent Debriefing Respondent debriefing typically consists of follow-up questions at the end of an interview that are designed to obtain quantitative information about respondents’ interpretations of survey questions. These questions help researchers determine whether concepts and questions were understood by respondents in the same way that the survey designers intended."

These questions help researchers determine whether concepts and questions were understood by respondents in the same way that the survey designers intended. In an interviewer-administered survey, the debriefing questions may be followed by a discussion between respondent and interviewer, to further probe the respondent’s reaction to and comprehension of the questions in the survey instrument. Interviewer Debriefing Evaluating pilot tests of demographic surveys conducted by personal interview has often centered on structured debriefing of field interviewers at the end of the test. Interviewers are trained prior to the survey and are asked to carefully record problems they encounter during the interview. Typically, interviewers know in advance that they will be participating in debriefing discussions at the end of the pilot test. Although some valuable insights can be obtained from interviewers, it is important to recognize that they may not always be accurate reporters of certain types of questionnaire problems or may be conveying their opinions more than respondents’ problems. For example, when interviewers report a problem, researchers cannot assess whether it was troublesome for one respondent or for 43 Questionnaire Design many, or whether the problem reflects the interviewer’s own preference or understanding of the question rather than respondent confusion. In addition, experienced interviewers sometimes change the wording of problem questions as a matter of course to make them work, and may not even realize they have done so."

In addition, experienced interviewers sometimes change the wording of problem questions as a matter of course to make them work, and may not even realize they have done so. Split Panel Designs In a split panel field test, respondents are randomly assigned into different groups to receive different versions of the questions. This is a very useful method for comparing two (or more) different versions of the same question or testing question-order effects because the responses can be compared between the different panels to examine the potential impact of the change on survey estimates. Behavior Coding Behavior coding focuses on the overt behavior of interviewers and respondents as they interact during the survey interview. Although behavior coding can be done by an evaluator in real time during the interaction between the interviewer and respondent, frequently the interaction is recorded and then coded by one or more evaluators. There are a variety of coding systems that reflect errors made by the interviewer and difficulties the respondent has with the questions. Because it is a quantitative method, a relatively large number of interviews need to be coded and statistical summaries created to identify problematic questions. Data Review A data review of the pilot test results is conducted to identify questions that have higher than expected or desired levels of non-response (either don’t knows or refusals)."

Data Review A data review of the pilot test results is conducted to identify questions that have higher than expected or desired levels of non-response (either don’t knows or refusals). High item nonresponse in a pilot test could indicate poor question wording, generally unavailable data, or non-applicability of the question to a significant subset of respondents. Because data review involves examination of quantitative results from the pilot test, larger numbers of respondents may be needed with more complex instruments to ensure that an adequate number of respondents are asked each question. 50. What do agencies need to do to obtain clearance for pretesting activities? Pretesting activities, including cognitive interviews and focus groups, must comply with requirements of the PRA, which are detailed in 5 C.F.R. § 1320. Although agencies do not need OMB approval to test draft questionnaires when they are administered to fewer than 10 persons, agencies must obtain approval to conduct iterative testing of the same questions even with minor modifications, on a total of 10 or more persons.20 Thus, it is not acceptable for an agency to test a questionnaire on seven individuals, make minor format and grammar changes, and test those revised questions on another seven people without OMB approval. Focus groups are also subject to the PRA (see question #7)."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,48,"Thus, it is not acceptable for an agency to test a questionnaire on seven individuals, make minor format and grammar changes, and test those revised questions on another seven people without OMB approval. Focus groups are also subject to the PRA (see question #7). Because most meaningful pretesting, especially iterative rounds of testing on different versions of questions, will require more than nine persons, agencies will need to seek clearance to conduct their pretesting. 20 Note, however, that if fewer than 10 persons or entities make up a substantial proportion of the entire population, e.g., car manufacturers, the collection may also be subject to the PRA. 44 Questionnaire Design Agencies that plan to do pretesting activities, including cognitive interviews and focus groups, can obtain OMB approval in one of two ways. First, the pretesting activities can be described and submitted as part of the ICR for the final survey. When this approach is used, OMB approval usually includes a term of clearance that the agency must report to OMB the results of the pretesting and any changes to the survey instrument that were made based on the findings. Alternatively, the agency can submit a separate ICR just for the pretesting activities, and later submit an ICR for the final survey that reflects the results of the pretest. Agencies usually do the latter when the pretest involves a design that is complex, includes large numbers of respondents, or has a relatively high response burden. Agencies also should submit the pretest separately from the full-scale collection when little has been decided about the design of the final survey when the pretesting is planned."

Agencies also should submit the pretest separately from the full-scale collection when little has been decided about the design of the final survey when the pretesting is planned. 51. What is a generic clearance for pretesting activities? Agencies that regularly do pretesting and development work for multiple surveys have found it beneficial to obtain a generic clearance specifically for these kinds of studies. Once the overall generic clearance is obtained on the pretesting activities and methods that will be used (e.g., cognitive interviews, focus groups, respondent debriefings, etc.) through the normal clearance process, agencies can submit abbreviated collection requests on the specific questions to be tested and obtain expedited OMB review (often within 10 working days) of the specific study, which can greatly facilitate ongoing and iterative rounds of testing. For example, cognitive laboratories at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of the Census, and the National Center for Health Statistics have these clearances. The primary justification for having a generic clearance for pretesting is that agencies know in advance that methodological research is needed, but they cannot anticipate the specific kinds of tests or methods that will be used. Generic clearances provide a mechanism for agencies to quickly test and implement new survey questions that often arise to address policy issues or emerging programmatic needs."

Generic clearances provide a mechanism for agencies to quickly test and implement new survey questions that often arise to address policy issues or emerging programmatic needs. The generic clearance should only be used in a well-defined and structured context, such as methodological testing. It is not appropriate for an agency to use a generic clearance as a means to bypass the requirements of the PRA to conduct a variety of information collections. Agencies are encouraged to consult with their OMB desk officers before submitting a generic clearance to determine whether their plans are appropriate for this type of clearance (see also question #8).

Statistical classifications, definitions, and data sources encourage uniformity in data collection, analysis, and dissemination. They are designed and managed to support the full range of research and analytical objectives in a specific subject matter area rather than the needs of a specific program or a specific study. The general criteria OMB has for evaluating the standards have been relevancy, accuracy, currency, efficiency, minimization of burden, and stability (""continuity"" and/or ""comparability""). There is a clear trade-off between currency and stability; typically, revisions to these standards have been no more frequent than once every five years or longer. However, annual updates of statistical areas are issued based on Census Bureau population estimates. OMB currently has a number of different statistical classifications for demographic, economic, and geographic data, including data on race and ethnicity, industries, occupations, and statistical areas described in more detail in the following questions. In addition, there are some standard definitions of economic concepts for statistical purposes, and standard sources for Federal data for some demographic and economic statistics. 53.

These standards apply to all data collected for statistical use by Federal agencies and their contractors. Some standards also apply to data collected for administrative use. There are currently six statistical classifications adopted by OMB: • Federal Administrative Regions • Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas • North American Industry Classification System (formerly the Standard Industrial Classification of Establishments) • Standard Occupational Classification • Data on Race and Ethnicity • Fields of Science and Engineering (R&D) 47 Statistical Standards Classifications that have been updated after 1980 are available at www.whitehouse.gov/omb (Go to Statistical Programs and Standards).

The most commonly used OMB statistical classification for population-based surveys concerns data on race and ethnicity. The OMB standards provide how agencies must collect data on race and ethnicity if they are collecting this information—the standards do not require agencies to gather data on race and ethnicity. Most, if not all, of the population-based surveys or censuses have now implemented the 1997 standards for data on race and ethnicity. The OMB standards for data on race and ethnicity provide a minimum set of two categories for data on ethnicity: • Hispanic or Latino and • Not Hispanic or Latino, 49"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,53,"The OMB standards for data on race and ethnicity provide a minimum set of two categories for data on ethnicity: • Hispanic or Latino and • Not Hispanic or Latino, 49 Statistical Standards and five categories for data on race collected from individuals: • American Indian or Alaska Native, • Asian, • Black or African American, • Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and • White. Note: “other race” is not a response category. Respondents are to be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations. Based on research findings, the recommended forms for the instruction are Mark one or more, Select one or more, or Choose one or more (not check all that apply). The mode of administration should be taken into account when designing the exact wording of the question. For example, face-to-face surveys permit the use of flashcards with a listing of the racial categories, whereas a telephone administration must rely on the interviewer reading each of the categories. Examples of questions for different modes are provided in the Provisional Guidance on the Implementation of the 1997 Standards for Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.26 The standards permit the collection of greater detail; however, the additional categories must be organized in such a way that they can be aggregated into these minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity."

Self-reporting or self-identification using separate questions (the two-question format) for race and ethnicity is the preferred method for collecting the data; note that the question on ethnicity should precede the question on race. If self-reporting is not practicable or feasible, for example, when identification is done by funeral personnel, observer identification may be used. The use of the two-question format is strongly encouraged even when observer identification is used. All information collections that include data on race and ethnicity were to be in compliance with the 1997 standards by no later than January 1, 2003. If an agency believes the standard categories are inappropriate, the agency must request a specific variance from OMB.

One piece of information that can be very important to respondents is whether the Federal agency will keep their information confidential and use it only for statistical purposes. The statutory authority for such promises is also covered, as well as the requirements for documenting this authority in agency ICRs. 56. What should respondents be told about their participation in an information collection? The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires that agencies provide certain information to respondents to help them understand why they are being asked to respond, how they are supposed to respond, and the effects the collection of information may have on them.27 Within an agency, the Chief Information Officer or other designated official is responsible for ensuring that each collection of information informs and provides reasonable notice to respondents about the purpose of the study. Assuming that the basic information called for is provided, an agency can adjust the amount of detail provided depending on the scope, importance, and nature of the collection of information."

In the context of collecting data for statistical and research purposes,34 an agency pledge of confidentiality ""refers broadly to a quality or condition accorded to information as an obligation not to transmit that information to an unauthorized party. ""35 Most important is that the identity of respondents not be revealed, either deliberately or inadvertently, as part of data processing and dissemination. Respondents are more likely to provide information (and in the case of ""sensitive topics,"" the correct information) when they know the data that they provide will be kept confidential by the collecting agency. However, confidentiality is only meaningful when the agency is able to deliver the promised protection to the respondent, that is, ""the data gatherer must have the will, technical ability, and moral and legal authority to protect the data. ""36 Respondents may be given information on confidentiality in a number of different formats, depending on the mode of data collection."

""36 Respondents may be given information on confidentiality in a number of different formats, depending on the mode of data collection. For a mail survey, the information is provided either in a cover letter or in a statement printed on the questionnaire. In telephone surveys, interviewers typically include a few summary sentences to potential respondents, and may refer to an advance letter that was sent. For surveys conducted by in-person interviewers, an introductory letter is usually mailed in advance or presented to the respondent. Also, an agency might provide its interviewers with a fact sheet containing answers to ""frequently asked questions"" or a reference to a web site or toll free number. In short, the mode of data collection determines how best to communicate the pledge of confidentiality. Informed consent and pledges of confidentiality should be accurate and use words that are easy for the respondents to understand, taking into account their level of education. For example, a consent form for a survey of adults who have not completed high school should be composed at a basic reading level. To help ensure that respondents will understand a consent statement or confidentiality pledge, agencies should take several steps before sending a survey into the field."

For example, in the classification of national security information, ""confidential"" is one of three classification levels, the other two being “secret” and “top secret”. In such a context, “confidential is applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe"" (White House: Executive Order 12958, Part 1, Section 1.3(3); April 17, 1995).

If an agency pledges confidentiality to respondents, it must also cite the statutory authority it has to protect the confidentiality of the information in its ICR (see question #58). 58. What legal authority does an agency have to protect the confidentiality of information it is collecting? Before making a pledge of confidentiality, an agency must know whether or not it can protect the information. Some statistical agencies have specific legal authority to protect the confidentiality of the data they collect (e.g., the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation). When agencies with statutory protection pledge confidentiality, the data cannot be used for nonstatistical ""administrative purposes."" For example, data collected by the Bureau of the Census are immune from legal process and cannot be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial or administrative proceeding.37 For surveys conducted by contractors, agencies may also be able to protect the confidentiality of responses by including such protection in the terms of the contract signed by the vendor (see question #60). Agencies need to include in their ICRs all statements and pledges of confidentiality they are making to respondents, and they need to cite the statutory authority they have for those pledges and statements."

What is the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA)? Recent legislation has provided broad protection to information gathered solely for statistical purposes under a pledge of confidentiality. The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA)38 provides uniform protection to data gathered under a pledge of confidentiality that will be used exclusively for statistical purposes. A statistical purpose is defined as the description, estimation, or analysis of the characteristics of groups, without identifying the individuals or organizations that comprise such groups.39 Provided that the requirements for CIPSEA are met, this law can be used by any Federal agency to protect the statistical data it collects under a pledge of confidentiality alone or in addition to the agency’s existing statutory authority. This law prohibits disclosure of confidential statistical data and any nonstatistical uses of the data. Penalties for violations are a class E felony, punishable by up to five years in prison or a fine of $250,000 or both."

CIPSEA cannot be used to protect data if an agency plans to use the data for nonstatistical purposes, which include the use of information in identifiable form for anything other than a statistical purpose, such as any administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, adjudicative, or other purpose that affects the rights, privileges, or benefits of a particular identifiable respondent.41 However, the agency may be able to use other legal authority to protect the confidentiality of the data it has gathered. Other general Federal Government statutes that affect the confidentiality of information include the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Privacy Act can be useful in helping to ensure the confidentiality of information collected about private individuals. The Freedom of Information Act establishes the public’s right of access to Federal records. However, FOIA does have nine exemptions allowing agencies to withhold certain types of information from release. A key FOIA exemption (b)(4)42 allows an agency to withhold information when public release would cause substantial competitive harm. This exemption is useful when collecting proprietary information from businesses or other organizations that might be harmed if the information were publicly released. Agencies have also relied upon the Privacy Act and FOIA in some circumstances to prevent the release of information that was collected primarily for statistical and research purposes."

Agencies have also relied upon the Privacy Act and FOIA in some circumstances to prevent the release of information that was collected primarily for statistical and research purposes. Agencies have also used contracts with data collection contractors to protect the confidentiality of their data. Agencies can specify in contracts that only aggregate results from the survey can be given to the sponsoring agency, and that the agency does not own and cannot receive identifiable microdata. This kind of third-party collection may also increase participation from respondents who might be hesitant to provide some kinds of information directly to an agency. For example, prior to CIPSEA, the Energy Information Administration used this kind of arrangement for the household survey on Residential Energy Consumption because the agency had no statutory authority to protect this information from release. This kind of arrangement can limit the kinds of analyses the agency can do, but may be necessary to protect the confidentiality of respondent data. 40 Please contact the Statistical and Science Policy Branch at 202-395-3093. 41 Pub.

Operational procedures may include the administration of a survey in a secluded area, protection of survey forms in the possession of an interviewer, and so forth.

This section provides guidance on improving response rates and assessing potential nonresponse bias. Agencies should consult with trained survey methodologists in designing their surveys to minimize nonresponse bias. 62. Why are response rates important? A survey’s response rate is a valuable data quality and field performance indicator, and is probably the most widely cited single number associated with the generalizability of a survey’s results. A high response rate increases the likelihood that the survey results reflect the views and characteristics of the target population. Conversely, a low response rate can be an indicator of potential nonresponse bias, which would be detrimental to the accuracy of the results of a study in a variety of ways, including: • Survey estimates may be biased if those who choose to participate (respondents) differ substantially and systematically in some way from those who choose not to participate (nonrespondents). If these differences are related to critical information from the survey or the census, the results may be misleading or even erroneous. •"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,60,"If these differences are related to critical information from the survey or the census, the results may be misleading or even erroneous. • The standard errors of the survey estimates may also be biased because an incomplete sample may fail to capture the true variability that would be observed in a complete sample. Nonresponse can occur for a variety of reasons, such as refusals, failure to contact the respondent, or the respondent’s inability to respond due to language barriers, illness, etc. Often these different reasons for nonresponse reflect different causes, and thus, have different implications for reducing nonresponse and the potential for nonresponse bias. For example, in a household survey, noncontact may be due to respondents spending less time at home and may require more attempts by interviewers to reach them. Noncontacts may spend their time quite differently from people who are at home more, and therefore, their absence may lead to bias in survey estimates related to activities away from home. In contrast, a respondent who refuses may not be interested in the topic of the survey and may need greater persuasion as to the importance of the survey or an incentive to participate. The absence of data from the cohort of refusals may lead to bias in survey estimates of the prevalence or attitudes in the population about the main survey topic. Agencies need to carefully consider the intended uses of the survey results and the potential impact of nonresponse bias on their data (see questions #18, #19, and #20)."

Agencies need to carefully consider the intended uses of the survey results and the potential impact of nonresponse bias on their data (see questions #18, #19, and #20). Agencies need to provide their best estimate for expected response rates in their ICRs and the basis for those estimates, e.g., prior surveys conducted by the agency, or similar survey methods used on similar populations by other organizations. Although response rates do not provide a clear indication of 56 Response Rates nonresponse bias (because such bias is also a function of the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on specific survey estimates), response rates can be a useful indicator of the risk of nonresponse bias and should be computed and used by agencies to inform decisions on making efforts to improve cooperation and assessing potential nonresponse bias. 63. How should response rates be calculated? Response rates have been calculated in a wide variety of ways, making comparisons across different surveys difficult. Recently, there have been attempts to standardize the calculation of response rates to provide a common basis for comparison. For example, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) has provided a set of six standard definitions of response rates as well as other formulas for calculating cooperation rates, refusal rates, and contact rates.44"

For example, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) has provided a set of six standard definitions of response rates as well as other formulas for calculating cooperation rates, refusal rates, and contact rates.44 The variations in response rate calculations depend on how partial responses are considered and how cases of unknown eligibility are handled. Agencies are encouraged to use the AAPOR standard formulas in calculating and reporting response rates in their ICRs; however, agencies may use other formulas as long as the method used to calculate response rates is documented in the ICR. At their most basic level, response rates can be viewed simply as the result of dividing the number of completed interviews/questionnaires by the number of eligible respondents who were selected to participate. Potential respondents may be split into the following categories: 1. Eligible and interview completed (c). 2. Eligible and not interviewed (e). 3. Ineligible (e.g., out of scope) (i). 4."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,61,"3. Ineligible (e.g., out of scope) (i). 4. Unable to determine eligibility (u). Potential respondents that are eligible and not interviewed (e) may include refusals, non-contacts, non-interview due to incapacity, language difficulties, or other reasons for nonresponse. The response rate formula discussed below includes in the denominator an estimate for the proportion of cases of unknown eligibility that are actually eligible, which can be an important component for some surveys, like Random Digit Dialing (RDD) surveys, that often have many phone numbers that are never answered. Sometimes only partial interviews are obtained due to a respondent’s breaking off an interview or completing only part of a mailed questionnaire. For these cases, agencies need to set thresholds for completion of a proportion of the questionnaire or certain key items in order for the case to be counted as a completed interview. Thus, these cases would be treated either as eligible and interview completed (c) if all required items are completed or as eligible and not interviewed (e) if any required items are missing. The total number of participants selected to be in the survey (n) is the sum of eligible and completed (c), eligible and not interviewed (e), ineligible (i), and unable to determine eligibility (u).

The response rate formula above is unweighted because every case is treated equally. An unweighted response rate is used to measure the proportion of the sample that resulted in useable information for analysis, and it is a useful indicator of field performance. A weighted response rate can be defined as the proportion of the survey population for which useable information is available. In some instances, the two response rates may result in identical values (if a census is taken or if a sample is selected with equal probability (see question #64). 64. When should weighted response rates be reported? As noted in question #63, unweighted and weighted response rates may result in different values if a sample is selected with different probabilities of selection as the result of oversampling or undersampling specific subpopulations."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,62,"When should weighted response rates be reported? As noted in question #63, unweighted and weighted response rates may result in different values if a sample is selected with different probabilities of selection as the result of oversampling or undersampling specific subpopulations. Oversampling or undersampling of specific subpopulations occurs when the sample size for a specific subpopulation is increased (relative to the remainder of the population) to support analytic objectives and goals. For example, the analytic objectives for a study may require a sampling design with oversampling of persons in minority subpopulations or in rural areas to permit sufficiently precise estimates for these subpopulations. The oversampling of specific subpopulations will assign a higher probability of selection for units in the oversampled subpopulation than for units in the undersampled subpopulations or in the remainder of the full population. Many Federal studies use oversampling of specific subpopulations to support analyses in a cost and statistically efficient fashion. The weighted response rate takes into account the oversampling and undersampling of the subpopulation by using the sampling weights (which are computed from the inverse of the selection probabilities). By using the sampling weight, this weighted response rate is an unbiased estimate of the proportion of the target population for which useable data are available. Weighted response rates are often used differently in establishment surveys to take into account the relative importance assigned to different reporting units (rather than probability of selection as is done in household surveys). For example, it is common that a few very large businesses dominate an industry in terms of their production or sales with many smaller firms accounting for only a small percentage of the total production or sales within the United States."

In this case, weighted response rates may be constructed as the ratio of the total weighted quantity for responding units to the total weighted quantity for all eligible units to obtain a rate that reflects the proportion of the quantity being estimated that is being covered by the survey respondents. Because unweighted and weighted response rates can provide different and useful information, agencies should generally report both in their ICRs. Whenever there are complex sample designs or the probability of selection is not equal for all cases, it is essential that weighted response rates be reported. Similarly, agencies should always report weighted response rates for establishment surveys in their ICRs and describe what is used for the weight. 65. What are typical response rates for Federal Government statistical surveys?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,63,"65. What are typical response rates for Federal Government statistical surveys? National surveys conducted by and for Federal statistical agencies to provide official Federal statistics generally have much larger samples, invest more resources, and achieve higher response rates than surveys sponsored by academic or commercial organizations. While some Federal surveys are mandatory, the vast majority are voluntary. For example, the Current Population Survey that provides the monthly unemployment rate is a voluntary monthly survey of over 50,000 households and has a response rate of 93 percent at the household level The Paperwork Reduction Act does not specify a minimum response rate. In the 1980's and 1990's, many Federal surveys achieved response rates above 90 percent. Such high performance levels were well known in major household surveys, and OMB research in the 1980's showed equally high performance in many important business surveys, with a median response rate of about 90 percent across all business surveys conducted as ""small censuses"" or ""probability samples"" by major statistical agencies. In the 1990's, due to changing social and business environments, many business and household surveys saw a slippage in their response rates. In 2001, OMB examined 199 general statistical survey information collections that were approved in 1998. OMB requested detailed information from agencies on the actual response rates achieved."

The distribution of response rates showed that about two-thirds of surveys achieved response rates above 80 percent and eighty percent of surveys achieved response rates above 70 percent. Although one might expect there to be large differences between household and establishment surveys or voluntary versus mandatory surveys, average response rates for these different types of surveys were in fact very similar. There were also small overall differences in survey response rates by mode, though it should be noted that most of the surveys were multi-mode (further information about the methods and results of this study can be found in Lu (2002)).45 45 Lu, R.

(Available at www.fcsm.gov/reports.) 59 Response Rates The studies noted above reflect a snapshot of response rates at a particular point in time. More recent, but less systematic observations suggest that response rates have been decreasing in many ongoing surveys in the past few years. Some evidence suggests these declines have occurred more rapidly for some data collection modes (such as RDD telephone surveys) and are more pronounced for non-government surveys than Federal Government surveys. Generally, these declines have occurred despite increasing efforts and resources that have been expended to maintain or bolster response rates. It is likely that agencies will need to increase attention to their survey methods and expand innovations to continue to ensure that information gathered through Federal statistical surveys yields high quality, useful information. The next few questions and answers are intended to help agencies evaluate their response rates, improve survey methods through the sharing of best practices, and assess potential nonresponse bias using a variety of methodologies. 66. What are acceptable response rates for different kinds of survey collections?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,64,"66. What are acceptable response rates for different kinds of survey collections? The 2001 OMB study of information collections described in question #65 clearly shows that the majority of Federal statistical surveys achieve good response rates. Response rates are an important indicator of the potential for non-response bias (see question #62). Clearly, the lower the response rate, the greater the caution or risk that bias can occur. Therefore, agencies should strive to obtain the highest practical rates of response, commensurate with the importance of survey uses, respondent burden, and data collection costs. Agencies should also plan additional efforts to study non-response bias if projected response rates suggest the potential for bias to occur. An agency’s justification for a survey response rate should reflect, at least in part, the intended use of the data. For example, surveys collecting influential information or information that will otherwise have a substantial impact on an agency’s programs or policies should be designed to minimize all sources of survey error (see question #20), including nonresponse bias. As defined in OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines, “influential” means that “an agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.”"

As defined in OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines, “influential” means that “an agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.” The Information Quality Guidelines require that agencies hold the information they designate as “influential” to a higher standard of reproducibility and transparency than information that is not defined as influential under the Information Quality Guidelines (see also question #18). Agencies need to document in their ICRs the importance and use of the information and the methods they will use to achieve acceptable response rates for their collections. In their ICRs, agencies need to report expected response rates for their surveys, which should reflect the overall unit response rate as calculated in questions #63 and #64. For ongoing surveys, the most recent actual achieved response rates should also be reported. As noted in question #62, agencies should use expected response rates as an indicator of potential risk for nonresponse bias. Agencies are encouraged to carefully consider how they can use current and new methodological tools to maximize data quality and minimize nonresponse bias.

pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,64,"ICRs for surveys with expected response rates of 80 percent or higher need complete descriptions of the 60 Response Rates basis of the estimated response rate and a detailed description of steps that will be taken to achieve the expected response rate (see question #69). ICRs for surveys with expected response rates lower than 80 percent need complete descriptions of how the expected response rate was determined, a detailed description of steps that will be taken to maximize the response rate (see question #69), and a description of plans to evaluate nonresponse bias (see question #71). Agencies also need a clear justification as to why the expected response rate is adequate based on the purpose of the study and the type of information that will be collected (whether influential or not). This discussion may include past experience with response rates when studying this population, prior investigations of nonresponse bias, plans to evaluate nonresponse bias, and plans to use survey methods that follow best practices that are demonstrated to achieve good response rates (see question #69). The ICR should also include a discussion of the selection of the mode of data collection and its impact on the expected response rate. ICRs with lower response rates are often justified by agencies in cases when they are seeking to gather information that is planned for internal use only, is exploratory, or is not intended to be generalized to a target population. Examples for these kinds of collections may include some customer satisfaction and web site user surveys and other qualitative or anecdotal collections. While the focus is often on the overall unit response rate, agencies should also pay attention to response rates for specific subgroups or levels (e.g., regions or states) for which the agency produces estimates. For example, if each state collects data from establishments within the state or if the agency produces estimates for each state, then response rates for each state should be examined."

For example, if each state collects data from establishments within the state or if the agency produces estimates for each state, then response rates for each state should be examined. In this case, an agency may achieve an acceptable response rate at the national level, but could have substantial problems in some states that should not be overlooked. Oftentimes, OMB may require in the terms of clearance that the agency report to OMB the actual response rate achieved at the completion of the data collection and the results of any nonresponse bias analyses or investigations. Even after the approval and fielding of an information collection, agencies should be prepared to provide detailed response rate information to OMB upon request. 67. Do longitudinal and multi-stage surveys need to achieve the same levels of response rates as other surveys? In multi-stage and longitudinal surveys, the response rate for the last stage or latest wave is only one component of the overall response rate. While each stage or wave may have a high response rate, it is the overall unit response rate that is the most comprehensive indicator of potential nonresponse bias. Agencies that submit ICRs with multi-stage sampling plans should provide expected response rates for each stage of the sampling process, and the total response rate, taking into account all stages or prior waves."

Agencies that submit ICRs with multi-stage sampling plans should provide expected response rates for each stage of the sampling process, and the total response rate, taking into account all stages or prior waves. The final (or cumulative) response rate should be calculated by multiplying each stage’s response rate together and should be considered an indicator for the risk of nonresponse bias and used accordingly, as noted in question #66. For these types of surveys, agencies may chose to focus their nonresponse bias analyses on a particular stage or wave that appears to be the greatest contributor towards nonresponse or take into account all stages/waves. For example, in longitudinal surveys, the response rate for each wave after the initial wave is often high, and the major contributor to the response rate may be the initial recruitment into the study. In such a case an agency may want to compare respondents 61 Response Rates and nonrespondents to the first wave but wait to examine bias due to attrition until later waves when response rates have dropped to 80 percent or less from the first wave (see question #71). 68. Are different response rates acceptable for different modes of data collection? Different modes of data collection typically yield differences in response rates, depending on the target population and specific methods used. For example, while a 60 percent response rate to a mail survey or RDD telephone survey may be considered quite good for some populations, such a response rate would not be considered as good for a personal visit survey."

For example, while a 60 percent response rate to a mail survey or RDD telephone survey may be considered quite good for some populations, such a response rate would not be considered as good for a personal visit survey. However, there are not established differences in risk for nonresponse bias by mode that would suggest that a 60 percent response rate in one mode carries a higher risk of nonresponse bias than another mode. Therefore, OMB has not set different thresholds in question #66 for different data collection modes. Agencies need to consider how the choice of data collection mode will affect their response rates, potential for nonresponse bias, and the information that will be available to assess potential nonresponse bias (see question #71) and weigh these factors along with the other advantages and disadvantages of the modes or modes of collection they are considering. Agencies need to justify in their ICRs their choice of mode given the advantages and disadvantages of that mode (see question #37). 69. How can response rates be improved? Regardless of the type of information collection, widely-acknowledged procedures can have a major effect on the number of respondents who complete the information request. Agencies should consult with professional survey methodologists in designing their information collections and consider answers to the following questions to maximize response rates: • Is the agency sending an advance letter to respondents?"

Agencies should consult with professional survey methodologists in designing their information collections and consider answers to the following questions to maximize response rates: • Is the agency sending an advance letter to respondents? Even for RDD surveys, agencies can obtain addresses for a large proportion of the phone numbers they have in their sample through vendors that offer reverse matching. Sending a letter in advance to inform respondents about the survey can lead to improved response rates. The letter should: o be signed by a senior agency official; o be personally addressed to the respondent if possible; o provide meaningful motivation for the respondent to participate; o answer questions of who, what, when, why, and how; o address how long the survey will take and whether participation is voluntary, mandatory, or required to obtain benefits (if the survey is mandatory some agencies opt to state this on the outside envelope rather than in the letter); o contain a contact number (toll-free phone if possible) for respondents to verify the legitimacy of the survey or ask questions; and o include any confidentiality pledge or assurance of anonymity (which should also be provided with the questionnaire if it is a mail survey). 62 Response Rates • Has the agency considered ways to promote awareness of the survey? Agencies should utilize their websites and consider obtaining the endorsement of stakeholders, interest groups, and community leaders.

Sometimes data from the missing wave can also be “filled in” based on subsequent interviews with the respondent. For example, some longitudinal studies will ask respondents about life events such as marriages, births of children, jobs, etc., that occurred since the last interview, and this information may be used to fill in questions asked in a prior missed wave. • For personal visit and telephone surveys, has the agency clearly described the number and timing of contact attempts?

Agencies should ensure that they can adequately protect the confidentiality of the information and communicate this to respondents (see questions #56 to #61). To provide a clearer barrier between the agency and the respondent, agencies can also consider using another agency or an external contractor to collect the data and specify in the contract that only aggregate results from the survey and no individually identifiable data can be given to the sponsoring agency. • Does the survey allow for an increase in the length of the field period to improve low response rates? • Have interviewers received adequate training about the survey and about interacting with respondents?

Given that Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone survey response rates have been declining, will OMB approve ICRs with this methodology? Some recent evidence suggests that response rates to RDD surveys have been declining more rapidly than those for other modes of data collection in the past few years. RDD surveys do have some advantages for certain types of studies (see question #41); however, agencies need to carefully consider their total survey design, weighing the expected response rates they are likely to achieve using RDD methodology against its other advantages for their particular survey."

OMB has approved ICRs for RDD studies when agencies provide a clear justification in their ICRs that this is the most appropriate methodology for their study, and agencies are using appropriate methods to maximize the response rate and assess and adjust for potential nonresponse bias and coverage error. 71. How can agencies examine potential nonresponse bias? Nonresponse bias associated with a survey statistic may be considered to have two components: the nonresponse rate and differences between respondents and nonrespondents. The lower the response rates are and the greater the differences between respondents and nonrespondents, the greater the nonresponse bias. Another way of looking at nonresponse bias is that it occurs when there is a correlation between the likelihood of participation in the survey and the survey variable(s) being measured. This view highlights the fact that some survey estimates may have nonresponse bias (because they are correlated with the likelihood of participation) while others do not. 64 Response Rates Agencies should plan to evaluate potential nonresponse bias if they expect response rates may fall below the levels noted in question #66; these plans should be described in their ICRs. When agencies are gathering influential information (under OMB information quality guidelines) or other information with a substantial impact on programs and policies that requires high precision, agencies should consider examining potential nonresponse bias even when normally acceptable response rates are achieved."

When agencies are gathering influential information (under OMB information quality guidelines) or other information with a substantial impact on programs and policies that requires high precision, agencies should consider examining potential nonresponse bias even when normally acceptable response rates are achieved. Because nonresponse bias is particular to each survey estimate, it is possible that some survey estimates are unbiased while others have a great deal of bias. Therefore, it is important that agencies attempt to assess nonresponse bias on key survey estimates. For example, a survey on willingness to pay for some environmental improvements should assess bias on the key estimate of willingness to pay (or something highly related to it); it is not sufficient for an agency to simply look at the demographic composition of the sample compared to, for example, the latest official Census figures and, if similar, conclude there is no nonresponse bias. Similarly, agencies cannot simply assume that because the demographic composition of their achieved sample was close to the composition of the decennial census before adjustment, that there is no bias on the other substantive survey variables or that making the weighting adjustments to the demographic composition of the sample will eliminate nonresponse bias in the other variables. Agencies should consult with professional statisticians and survey methodologists to ensure that potential nonresponse bias is addressed in the design of the study as options are far more limited after the collection has occurred. Although assessing bias and potentially adjusting the data to account for nonresponse can be complicated and time-consuming, there are a number of methods that can be used. These methods vary in the amount and kind of information that is available on respondents and nonrespondents. At a minimum, agencies should plan to compare respondents and nonrespondents on information available from the sampling frame."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,69,"These methods vary in the amount and kind of information that is available on respondents and nonrespondents. At a minimum, agencies should plan to compare respondents and nonrespondents on information available from the sampling frame. Sampling frames that include data on various attributes of the population unit are helpful in examining whether response rates vary on those attributes or whether the characteristics of respondents and nonrespondents differ on these characteristics. For example, response rates from large companies versus small can be compared for establishment surveys. In addition, agencies should seek out other available external information that they may be able to match to their sampling frame that would provide some insights into nonresponse bias. For example, agencies that survey their program participants may have other administrative data that can be matched at the individual level to compare respondents and nonrespondents more directly. If this kind of information is not available, there are other possibilities to consider, such as mapping telephone exchanges in an RDD survey to census tracts or zip codes, and then matching with aggregated data from the Census long form, permitting comparison of respondents and nonrespondents at an area level (as opposed to the specific household). Another source of information in longitudinal surveys is to compare respondents and nonrespondents on characteristics gathered at prior waves. For some multi-stage surveys, agencies should consider including items at a screener stage that may be useful in comparing respondents and nonrespondents to the later extended interview. 65"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,69,"For some multi-stage surveys, agencies should consider including items at a screener stage that may be useful in comparing respondents and nonrespondents to the later extended interview. 65 Response Rates When there are no good sources of information about respondents and nonrespondents on the substantive variables of interest, agencies can also use additional follow-up procedures with an abbreviated questionnaire to estimate the characteristics of nonrespondents on some key variables of interest. Sometimes these follow-up studies are done by selecting a probability sample of nonrespondents for extensive and more expensive efforts on a smaller sample that are then used to estimate the characteristics of all nonrespondents and compare to respondents. Agencies can also assess potential nonresponse bias by analyzing differences between respondents and initial refusals (who were later “converted”) or conduct analyses of key estimates by levels of effort to obtain the response (e.g., the number of reminders sent for a mail survey or the number of calls made in a telephone survey). Finally, agencies can also evaluate and compare different methods of nonresponse weighting adjustments using additional variables and information noted above to see what impact these have on the key survey estimates. All of the above methods have varying strengths and weaknesses in providing useful information on nonresponse bias. Thus, agencies should attempt to use a variety of methods whenever possible. 72. What response rate issues are involved with using samples derived from pre-existing multipurpose panels, such as Internet or consumer panels? Multi-purpose consumer and Internet survey panels are similar to multi-stage surveys or longitudinal studies in that there are several stages of agreement and participation by respondents over some period of time before they become members of the panel (see question #67)."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,70,"What response rate issues are involved with using samples derived from pre-existing multipurpose panels, such as Internet or consumer panels? Multi-purpose consumer and Internet survey panels are similar to multi-stage surveys or longitudinal studies in that there are several stages of agreement and participation by respondents over some period of time before they become members of the panel (see question #67). Panel members are also typically expected to participate in the panel for some fixed period of time and complete some number of surveys during that time. Often the only response rate reported for studies using these panels is based on the number of panel members who completed the specific survey and those who did not; however, this provides a very incomplete picture, because each prior stage of selection or participation, including dropping out of the panel before a respondent’s scheduled time was completed, potentially affects the representativeness of the panel, may introduce nonresponse bias, and must be taken into account in calculating the overall response rate. For example, one vendor who conducts Internet panel surveys has documented that in 2002, a 36 percent response rate for households agreeing to join the panel was achieved. However, this was only the first stage; of those households who agreed, only 67 percent actually installed the equipment for Internet access, and only 47 percent of installed households had an adult who completed the profile and was an active panel participant available to complete a survey. Although individual survey response rates averaged 75 to 80 percent of these active members, the cumulative response rate taking into account all stages (.36*.67*.47*.80) was about 9 percent. 66 Response Rates Because of the multiple stages of initiation of a prospective panel member and the resulting opportunities for nonresponse, different biases due to nonresponse may enter into the panel at different stages. For example, those who agree to become part of the panel may be systematically different from those who do not agree to join the panel, and those who do not install the equipment or complete the profile may be different from those who remain in the panel. Panel members also often depart from the panel before their “term” is completed, introducing further potential nonresponse bias due to attrition."

Panel members also often depart from the panel before their “term” is completed, introducing further potential nonresponse bias due to attrition. In their ICRs, agencies proposing to use multipurpose survey panels should provide a justification for their use, provide expected response rates in detail, and devote careful attention to potential nonresponse bias as warranted (see questions #66, #67, and #71). Although these panels have been used as a convenience sample and/or for pilot studies, there is some recent research that examines the quality of estimates from these panels.46 OMB will continue to monitor this research area and evaluate results from agency studies on nonresponse bias. Agencies should carefully consider the response rates that they are likely to achieve and the quality of the information that they will be able to obtain from pre-existing multi-purpose survey panels, taking into account the utility of the data for its intended use. While there may appear to be cost and time advantages to using a pre-existing panel, the quality of estimates obtained using this method will require careful scrutiny to ensure it is sufficient to meet its intended purposes. In their ICRs, agencies need to justify use of a multipurpose survey panel and describe how they will attempt to assess and address the potential nonresponse bias and other limitations of these panels (see question #71). 73.

The focus of this section has been on unit nonresponse, the failure to obtain any participation from the respondent. However, even when respondents agree to participate in a survey, they do not necessarily provide all of the information that the agency requests. Thus, agencies also need to examine nonresponse to questionnaire items to see what impact this has on their results. Agencies should note in their ICRs if substantial item nonresponse is expected for any key or sensitive items, and how this will be handled. Similar to unit nonresponse, agencies need to consider the risk of nonresponse bias at the item level. At a minimum, agencies should plan to conduct nonresponse bias analyses (see question #71) if an item missing rate exceeds 30 percent, but agencies should consider lower thresholds for key variables. Because respondents have provided information to other items on the questionnaire, there is generally a great deal of 46 For example, see Cameron, T.A. & DeShazo, J.R. (November, 2005).

For key survey estimates, many large statistical surveys use a variety of statistical methods to impute values for the missing items. These imputation methods include identifying “donor” records that are similar to the case with the missing item on a variety of other variables and replacing the missing value with the value from the donor case. Other methods use regression or other statistical models to predict values for the missing variable based on complete cases and then generate a value for the missing case from this model. Agencies should consult with trained survey statisticians on the appropriate ways to handle missing item data in their surveys. Agencies need to specify how they will handle missing item data and assess or control potential nonresponse bias, including whether the information will be imputed. If an agency uses imputation, the method that will be used should be described in the ICR. 74. What are incentives?"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,72,"74. What are incentives? An incentive is defined as a positive motivational influence; something that induces action or motivates effort. Incentives are often used in market research, and sometimes used in survey research, to encourage participation. They may be monetary or non-monetary, such as phone cards, books, calculators, etc. Incentives are often unconditional; that is, they are paid prior to and regardless of a respondent’s decision to participate in the study. Research has consistently shown that giving an unconditional incentive when first contacting the respondent is more effective in obtaining cooperation than the promise of an incentive after completion of the survey. Incentives are most appropriately used in Federal statistical surveys with hard-to-find populations or respondents whose failure to participate would jeopardize the quality of the survey data (e.g., in panel surveys experiencing high attrition), or in studies that impose exceptional burden on respondents, such as those asking highly sensitive questions, or requiring medical examinations (see question # 76). Incentives are also often used in studies used to develop surveys. For example, research subjects who participate in cognitive research protocols and focus groups are typically paid an incentive for their participation."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,72,"Incentives are also often used in studies used to develop surveys. For example, research subjects who participate in cognitive research protocols and focus groups are typically paid an incentive for their participation. Distinctions are sometimes made between an honorarium and an incentive. An honorarium is a payment given to professional individuals or institutions for services for which fees are not legally or traditionally required in order to secure their participation. Thus, this term is more appropriately used for payments to physicians, accountants, school administrators, teachers, and so forth. An honorarium is usually paid on the condition of a respondent’s participation as a token of appreciation. 68 Response Rates 75. Why must agencies provide a justification to give incentives to respondents? While incentives have been used in the private sector without much controversy, most Federal Government surveys do not provide incentives to respondents, and the use of incentives by Federal agencies has raised a variety of concerns about their cost, the use of taxpayer funds, impact on survey responses, and implications for the “social contract” between the Federal Government and citizens. The regulations implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 prohibited the use of incentives for respondents to Federal surveys unless agencies could demonstrate a substantial need."

The regulations implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 prohibited the use of incentives for respondents to Federal surveys unless agencies could demonstrate a substantial need. The regulations implementing the 1995 reauthorization of the PRA require agencies to justify any payments to respondents. In keeping with these concerns, OMB’s guidelines on providing incentives to respondents follow a general conceptual framework that seeks to avoid the use of incentives except when the agency has clearly justified the need for the incentive and has demonstrated positive impacts on response and data quality by using an incentive (see question #76). 76. What factors should agencies address in their justification to give incentives to respondents? Research has consistently shown that monetary incentives are more effective in increasing survey response than nonmonetary incentives. However, agencies should still consider appropriate nonmonetary incentives, especially if they are related to the survey (or the agency more generally) and are likely to be of interest to respondents. For example, respondents to a business survey on wages may be very interested in the results to see how they compare to the industry average, and schools may find curriculum materials or books for the library an effective incentive. Other examples of nonmonetary incentives that agencies sometimes use include items directly related to the data collection, such as a folder for receipts or a calculator for respondents in a survey on expenditures."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,73,"For example, respondents to a business survey on wages may be very interested in the results to see how they compare to the industry average, and schools may find curriculum materials or books for the library an effective incentive. Other examples of nonmonetary incentives that agencies sometimes use include items directly related to the data collection, such as a folder for receipts or a calculator for respondents in a survey on expenditures. In lieu of a relevant nonmonetary incentive, agencies should consider appropriate monetary incentives (or debit cards with a PIN provided) instead of phone cards or gift certificates, as research has generally shown cash to be more effective. In justifying their proposed use of incentives, agencies should consider the following principles, many of which overlap: • Data quality: One possible justification for requesting use of an incentive is improvement in data quality. For example, agencies may be able to provide evidence that, because of an increase in response rates, an incentive will significantly improve validity and reliability to an extent beyond that possible through other means. • Burden on the respondent: An agency can justify an incentive if it can demonstrate that there is a need to pay a respondent for exerting unusual effort or having an unusual reporting burden in responding to a collection of information. This type of effort can be seen in data collections that require respondents to keep daily logs for an extended period of time, participate in a medical examination, abstract information from a significant number of records, coordinate study team visits, and so forth. 69 Response Rates • Complex study design: Some studies require ongoing participation of various respondents, each of whom is important to the achievement of study goals. For example, there may be a panel study over multiple years that requires participation by the same schools, teachers, parents, and students. •"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,74,"For example, there may be a panel study over multiple years that requires participation by the same schools, teachers, parents, and students. • Past experience: Agencies may be able to justify the use of incentives by relating past survey experience, results from pretests or pilot tests, or findings from similar studies. This is especially true where there is evidence of attrition and/or poor prior response rates. • Improved coverage of specialized respondents, rare groups, or minority populations: A survey may have as its target population a highly selective group. Offering incentives to this population can be justified by describing the importance and difficulty of obtaining their participation in the study. For example, a study on the health of the hearing- impaired may propose providing an incentive to obtain enough respondents with particular impairments to participate. Similarly, a justification to pay an incentive for a study that involves recruiting highly specialized physicians may be considered. • Reduced survey costs: If prior or similar surveys have devoted considerable resources to nonresponse follow-up, it may be possible to demonstrate that the cost of incentives will be less than the costs of extensive follow-up. While some personal visit surveys have found that the cost of incentives has been made up in reduced field interviewer time and travel costs, this is rarely true for other data collection modes."

While some personal visit surveys have found that the cost of incentives has been made up in reduced field interviewer time and travel costs, this is rarely true for other data collection modes. Thus, agencies should not assume that incentives will pay for themselves. • Equity: Agencies should treat all respondents equally with regard to incentives. OMB generally does not approve agency plans to give incentives solely to convert refusals, or treat specific subgroups differently, unless the plan is part of an experimental design for further investigation into the effects of incentives. • Research into the effects of incentives: Because OMB has expressed interest over the years in encouraging research into the effects of incentives, proposals that include experimental designs that provide insight into incentive effects are often approved. Agencies should plan to examine not only the impact on overall response rates by the use of an incentive, but also the effects on key estimates (with a similar purpose to that addressed in question #71).

Agencies should clearly describe how weights will be derived and any adjustments that will be made to the weights to minimize potential nonresponse or coverage errors. When analyzing data from a complex survey design, agencies must ensure that appropriate statistical methods and software are used so that accurate estimates and associated variances or standard errors of those estimates are reported. For complex sample designs, specialized software is necessary that takes into account the sample design in estimating the variances. The statistical methods and software should be clearly identified in the ICR. Often, research questions involve comparisons between groups or subgroups. Agencies should specify what statistical tests will be used to assess potential differences between the groups. The information collection should be designed with an appropriate sample size so that planned comparisons between groups or subgroups have adequate statistical power to statistically detect the differences between the groups or subgroups that are likely to exist (see question #33).

When possible, agencies should include table shells or actual results from prior collections to show how the information will be presented. If detailed estimates by subgroups are planned, agencies should also describe criteria that are used to determine the amount of detail that is published in a table or figure. For example, agencies should consider criteria such as a minimum sample size, precision of the estimate, or potential disclosure risk (see question #61) in publishing estimates in tables. Sometimes, agencies use the data gathered from a survey as inputs to models (e.g., economic forecasting models, biomechanical models) to conduct analyses. For recurring collections, agencies should submit information on the relevant models with sufficient details to allow OMB to assess the practical utility of the data being collected. For one-time collections, agencies should submit as much information as possible on the tentative models and analytic plans. 72"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,76,"72 Analysis and Reporting 78. What predissemination review do agencies need to do for reports based on surveys or statistical collections? Agencies are responsible for the quality of the information that they disseminate and must institute appropriate review procedures to comply with OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines. Agencies proposing information products that involve reporting results from surveys or other statistical collections should include as part of their review process a statistical and methodological review to ensure that appropriate statistical methods are used and reported. The reviewer should have appropriate expertise in the methodology that is used, and should be provided with sufficient technical documentation to evaluate the information in the report (See OMB Peer Review Bulletin).47 The statistical and methodological review should include an evaluation of the suitability of the statistical methods used, the accuracy of the assumptions and limitations of the data, and the appropriateness of the conclusions and technical recommendations (from a statistical perspective). The statistical and methodological review should also include examination of presentations of data in tables or figures as well as examination of any public use datasets that are released. Agencies must ensure that appropriate statistical disclosure limitation methods and procedures have been followed in keeping with the confidentiality pledge made to the respondents (see questions #57 and #61).

Generally, the same requirements described throughout this guidance for surveys collecting influential information apply to these surveys; however, some of these considerations are highlighted in this section with particular illustrations for this type of survey. 79. What are stated preference methods? Stated Preference Methods (SPM) have been developed and used in the peer-reviewed literature to estimate both “use” and “non-use’ values of goods and services. They have also been widely used in regulatory analyses by Federal agencies, in part because these methods can be creatively employed to address a wide variety of goods and services that are not easy to study through revealed preference methods."

They have also been widely used in regulatory analyses by Federal agencies, in part because these methods can be creatively employed to address a wide variety of goods and services that are not easy to study through revealed preference methods. The distinguishing feature of these methods is that questions about the use or non-use value of a good are posed to survey respondents in order to obtain willingness-to-pay estimates relevant to benefit or cost estimation. Some examples of SPM include contingent valuation, conjoint analysis, and risk-tradeoff analysis. The surveys used to obtain the health-utility values used in cost effectiveness analysis are similar to stated preference surveys but do not entail monetary measurement of value. Nevertheless, the principles governing quality stated preference research, with some obvious exceptions involving monetization, are also relevant in designing quality health-utility research. 80. What should agencies consider when designing questions for stated preference studies? Stated Preference Methods have been developed and used to estimate both “use” and “non-use” values of goods and services. Because these methods pose hypothetical questions about use or non-use values to survey respondents in order to obtain willingness-to-pay estimates relevant to benefit or cost estimation, the following principles should be considered when designing these questions: • the good or service being evaluated should be explained to the respondent in a clear, complete and objective fashion, and the survey instrument should be pre-tested; • willingness-to-pay questions should be designed to focus the respondent on the reality of budgetary limitations and on the availability of substitute goods and alternative expenditure options; and • the survey instrument should be designed to probe beyond general attitudes (e.g., a ""warm glow"" effect for a particular use or non-use value) and focus on the magnitude of the respondent's economic valuation."

In addition, the results from the questions should be consistent with economic theory using both ""internal"" (within respondent) and ""external"" (between respondent) scope tests such as the willingness to pay is larger (smaller) when more (less) of a good is provided. 74 Stated Preference Methods The challenge in designing quality stated preference studies is arguably greater for non-use values and unfamiliar use values than for familiar goods or services that are traded (directly or indirectly) in market transactions. The good being valued may have little meaning to respondents, and respondents may be forming their valuations for the first time in response to the questions posed. Since these values are effectively constructed by the respondent during the elicitation, the instrument and mode of administration should be rigorously pre-tested to make sure that responses are not simply an artifact of specific features of instrument design and/or mode of administration. 81. What factors should be considered when designing or evaluating studies using stated preference methods? When designing or evaluating a stated preference study, agencies need to consider all aspects of the survey design, including coverage of the target population, mode of data collection, sampling, questionnaire design, and response rates that are covered in more detail in the preceding sections (also see question #20)."

Since stated preference methods generate data from respondents in a hypothetical setting, often on complex and unfamiliar goods, special care is demanded in the design and execution of surveys, analysis of the results, and characterization of the uncertainties. A stated preference study may be the only way to obtain quantitative information about non-use values, though a number based on a poor quality study is not necessarily superior to no number at all. There is no simple formula that can be used to determine whether a particular study is of sufficient quality to justify its use in regulatory analysis. However, OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines require that agencies hold the information they designate as “influential” to a higher standard of reproducibility and transparency than information that is not defined as influential under the Information Quality Guidelines. As defined in OMB and agency Information Quality Guidelines, “influential” means that “an agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.” If SPM are used to support a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), weaknesses in the study design should be acknowledged, including any resulting biases or uncertainties that are suspected. If a study has too many weaknesses with unknown consequences for the quality of the data, the study should not be used for an RIA. In employing SPM for regulatory analyses agencies should consider the following: • documentation should be provided about the target population, the sampling frame used and its coverage of the target population, the design of the sample including any stratification or clustering, the cumulative response rate (including response rate at each stage of selection if applicable), the item non-response rate for critical questions, the exact wording and sequence of questions and other information provided to respondents, and the training of interviewers and techniques they employed (as appropriate); • the analytic results should be consistent with economic theory using both ""internal"" (within respondent) and ""external"" (between respondents) scope tests, such as the willingness to pay is larger (smaller) when more (less) of a good is provided; and 75"

A complex sample design is one that involves multiple stages, stratification, unequal probabilities of selection or clustering. Confidentiality involves the protection of individually identifiable data from unauthorized disclosures. A convenience sample is a nonprobability sample that is drawn from units of the population of interest that are close at hand or willing to participate. Coverage refers to the extent to which all elements on a frame list are members of the population, and to which every element in a population appears on the frame list once and only once. Coverage error refers to the discrepancy between statistics calculated on the frame population and the same statistics calculated on the target population. Undercoverage errors occur when target population units are missed during frame construction, and overcoverage errors occur when units are duplicated or enumerated in error. 78 Glossary A cut-off sample is a nonprobability sample that consists of the units in the population that have the largest values of a key variable (frequently the variable of interest from a previous time period). For example, a 90 percent cut-off sample consists of the largest units accounting for at least 90 percent of the population total of the key variable. Sample selection is usually done by sorting the population in decreasing order by size, and including units in the sample until the percent coverage exceeds the established cut-off."

The design effect (DEFF) is the ratio of the true variance of a statistic (taking the complex sample design into account) to the variance of the statistic for a simple random sample with the same number of cases. Design effects differ for different subgroups and different statistics; no single design effect is universally applicable to any given survey or analysis. Disclosure means the public release of individually identifiable data that were obtained under a pledge of confidentiality. -E- Editing is a procedure that uses available information and some assumptions to derive substitute values for inconsistent values in a data file. An eligible sample unit is a unit selected for a sample that is confirmed to be a member of the target population. An establishment survey is a survey of a business establishment."

An establishment survey is a survey of a business establishment. Estimates result from the process of providing a numerical value for a population parameter on the basis of information collected from a survey and/or other sources. Estimation is the process of using data from a survey and/or other sources to provide a value for an unknown population parameter (such as a mean, proportion, correlation, or effect size), or to provide a range of values in the form of a confidence interval. Estimation error is the difference between a survey estimate and the true value of the target population. An experimental design is a type of research design in which the researcher controls and manipulates conditions in order to assess the effect on some outcome of interest. Experiments are conducted when researchers want to be able to infer causality. An expert choice sample is a nonprobability sample in which an “expert” specifically chooses sample elements with certain characteristics to mimic ‘typical’ or ‘representative’ members of the population. -F- In a field test, all or some of the survey procedures are tested on a small scale that mirrors the planned full-scale implementation."

A focus group involves a semi-structured group discussion of a topic. Forecasting involves the specific projection that an investigator believes is most likely to provide an accurate prediction of a future value of some process. 79 Glossary A frame is a mapping of the universe elements (i.e., sampling units) onto a finite list (e.g., the population of schools on the day of the survey). The frame population is the set of elements that can be enumerated prior to the selection of a survey sample. -G­ A gatekeeper is a person who is between the interviewer and the respondent and may prevent the interviewer from gaining access to the respondent.

Thus, this term is more appropriately used for payments to physicians, CPAs, schools, administrators, teachers, and so forth. An honorarium is usually paid on the condition of a respondent’s participation as a token of appreciation. Hypothesis testing draws a conclusion about the tenability of a stated value for a parameter. For example, sample data may be used to test whether an estimated value of a parameter (such as the difference between two population means) is sufficiently different from zero that the null hypothesis, designated H0 (no difference in the population means), can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, H1 (a difference between the two population means). -I- Imputation is a procedure that uses available information and some assumptions to derive substitute values for missing values in a data file.

Individually identifiable data refers specifically to data from any list, record, response form, completed survey, or aggregation about an individual or individuals from which information about particular individuals or their schools/education institutions may be revealed by either direct or indirect means. Instrument refers to an evaluative device that includes tests, scales, and inventories to measure a domain using standardized procedures. It is commonly used in surveys to refer to the device used to collect data, such as a questionnaire or data entry software. Interactive voice response refers to a method for data collection in which a computer “reads” the question to respondents over the phone, and respondents reply by using the keypad or saying their answers aloud. Internal validity refers to the soundness of an experimental design so that the results reflect only the differences the researcher intended by manipulating the conditions, and the absence of alternative explanations for the results from the experiment. An Internet panel consists of a large sample of respondents who have volunteered or been recruited to participate in many surveys on the Internet over some period of time. 80 Glossary Interviewer bias refers to effects that interviewers may have that bias the survey results.

Interviewer debriefing is a method used in pretesting in which interviewers are asked to report any problems that they perceived that respondents had with the questions in the survey instrument. Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails to respond to one or more relevant item(s) on a survey. -K- Key variables include survey-specific items for which aggregate estimates are commonly published from a study. They include, but are not restricted to, variables most commonly used in table row stubs. Key variables also include important analytic composites and other policy- relevant variables that are essential elements of the data collection. They are first defined in the initial planning stage of a survey, but may be added to as the survey and resulting analyses develop. For example, a study of student achievement might use gender, race-ethnicity, urbanicity, region, and school type (public/private) as key reporting variables. -L­ A longitudinal sample survey follows the experiences and outcomes over time of a representative sample of respondents (i.e., a cohort) who are defined based on a shared experience (e.g., shared birth year or grade in school)."

Measurement error is the difference between observed values of a variable recorded under similar conditions and some fixed true value (e.g., errors in reporting, reading, calculating, or recording a numerical value). Response bias is the deviation of the survey estimate from the true population value that is due to measurement error from the data collection. Potential sources of response bias include the respondent, the instrument, and the interviewer. A microdata file includes the detailed responses for individual respondents. A mixed mode survey is one that uses more than one mode for data collection, for example, a mail survey is initially sent to respondents, but nonrespondents are called on the telephone to complete the survey. Mode of data collection refers to whether the information is gathered from respondents in a face-to-face interview, over the telephone, from a mail survey, or via a web survey."

A model is a formalized set of mathematical expressions quantifying the process assumed to have generated a set of observations. Model-based samples are selected to achieve efficient and robust estimates of the true values of the target populations under a chosen working model. A multi-stage design for a sample is a complex design in which the sample is selected in stages because a comprehensive listing of sample elements is not available. One example of a multi­ stage sample design for an area sample is first states may be selected, then counties, then a 81 Glossary census tract or block group within the county. The sample elements are then listed and finally selected for inclusion into the sample. -N- Nonprobabilistic methods are methods for selecting a sample that do not select sample elements such that each one has some known nonzero probability of being selected into the sample.

Common examples of nonprobability samples are convenience sample, quota samples, and expert choice samples. Nonresponse bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Nonresponse bias is likely to occur as a result of not obtaining 100 percent response from the selected cases. Nonresponse error is the overall error observed in estimates caused by differences between respondents and nonrespondents. It consists of a variance component and nonresponse bias. Nonsampling error includes measurement errors due to interviewers, respondents, instruments, and mode; nonresponse error; coverage error; and processing error. -O- Overall unit nonresponse reflects a combination of unit nonresponse across two or more levels of data collection, where participation at the second stage of data collection is conditional upon participation in the first stage of data collection."

An oversample refers to selecting some sample elements with probabilities greater than their proportion in the population usually in order to have a large enough sample to make separate estimates for a subgroup with greater precision than would be possible if the group was selected in proportion to its representation in the population. -P­ A panel survey is a survey that is repeated with the same respondents over some period of time. The p value is the probability of the observed data, or data showing a more extreme departure from the null hypothesis, occurring when the null hypothesis is true. In a pilot test, a laboratory or a very small-scale test of a questionnaire or procedure is conducted. Population—see “target population.” The power (1 – b) of a test is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative hypothesis is assumed. For example, with b = 0.20 for a particular alternative hypothesis, the power is 0.80, which means that 80 percent of the time the test statistic will fall in the rejection region if the parameter has the value specified by the alternative hypothesis."

Precision of survey results refers to how closely the results from a sample can reproduce the results that would be obtained from a complete count (i.e., census) conducted using the same techniques. The difference between a sample result and the result from a complete census taken under the same conditions is known as the precision of the sample result. A survey pretest involves experimenting with different components of the questionnaire or survey design or operationalization prior to full-scale implementation. This may involve pilot 82 Glossary testing, that is a laboratory or a very small-scale test of a questionnaire or procedure, or a field test in which all or some of the survey procedures are tested on a small scale that mirrors the planned full-scale implementation. Probabilistic methods for survey sampling are any of a variety of methods for sampling that give a known, non-zero, probability of selection to each member of the target population. The advantage of probabilistic sampling methods is that sampling error can be calculated. Such methods include: random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling."

Such methods include: random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling. They do not include: convenience sampling, judgment sampling, quota sampling, and snowball sampling. A probability sample is a sample that is selected so that each sample member has some known nonzero probability of being selected into the sample. Probability of selection in a survey is the probability that a given sampling unit will be selected, based on the probabilistic methods used in sampling. Proxy responses are responses provided by anyone other than the respondent who is reporting for the respondent or providing information about the respondent. For example, parents often report for young children in surveys. A public-use data file or public-use microdata file includes a subset of data that have been coded, aggregated, or otherwise altered to mask individually identifiable information, and thus is available to all external users. Unique identifiers, geographic detail, and other variables that cannot be suitably altered are not included in public-use data files. -Q-"
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,87,"Unique identifiers, geographic detail, and other variables that cannot be suitably altered are not included in public-use data files. -Q- A qualitative study is one done with the goal of obtaining rich information and insight to describe or explore a phenomena through a variety of methods such as focus groups, case studies, in-depth interviews, and observations. A quasi-experimental design is one in which the researcher is unable to assign persons randomly to conditions but is still able to have some control over the conditions. A quota sample samples are samples where units are selected nonrandomly based on a quota. The quota may be defined such that the final numbers of participating units with given characteristics have the same proportion as corresponding units have in the population. -R­ A RDD survey refers to Random Digit Dialing, which is a means of generating telephone numbers to select a random sample. Refusal conversion refers to the practice of having interviewers call back (either on the telephone or in-person) a respondent who has refused and attempt to gain his or her cooperation in the survey. Often the most effective interviewers in an organization are selected to do refusal conversions."

Often the most effective interviewers in an organization are selected to do refusal conversions. Reinterview refers to asking usually only a small subset of respondents to take the survey again or answer a subset of the survey questions again. Reinterviews may be conducted to assess interviewers or statistical properties of questions in the survey. Required response items include the minimum set of items required for a case to be considered a respondent. Respondent burden is the estimated total time and financial resources expended by the survey respondent to generate, maintain, retain, and provide survey information. 83 Glossary Respondent debriefing is a pretesting method in which respondents are asked questions about the survey questions after they have completed the survey. Respondents may be asked to report if they had any trouble understanding any of the questions or found any questions unclear or confusing. A response analysis survey is a study of the capability of respondents to accurately provide the data requested for a survey."

Response rates: see weighted response rate and unweighted response rate. -S­ A sample survey selects respondents from only a portion of the total target population using probability methods in order to make an inference about the target population. Sampling error is the error associated with nonobservation, that is, the error that occurs because all members of the frame population are not measured. It is the error associated with the variation in samples drawn from the same frame population. The variance equals the square of the sampling error. A sampling frame is a list or set of procedures for identifying all elements of a target population from which one can draw a sample. Sampling units are the basic components of a sample frame."
pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf,88,"A sampling frame is a list or set of procedures for identifying all elements of a target population from which one can draw a sample. Sampling units are the basic components of a sample frame. Everything covered by a sample frame must belong to one definite sampling unit, or have a measurable probability of belonging to a specific unit. The sampling unit may contain, for example, houses, people, or businesses. Sampling weights are the inverse of the probability of selection for a sample element. A simple random sample is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being selected, and all samples of a given size have the sample probability of being selected. Skip patterns are used in questionnaires to indicate when the next question should be skipped because of the respondent’s answer to the current question. On paper questionnaires, skip patterns may be indicated by arrows or instructions to go to a specific item. Computer-assisted interviews have the skip patterns programmed into the instrument. A snowball sample is a sample that is built by asking a respondent to provide the name of someone that he or she knows for the researcher to contact."

A snowball sample is a sample that is built by asking a respondent to provide the name of someone that he or she knows for the researcher to contact. It can be a useful technique to build a sample of individuals who have a rare condition and know one another. Social desirability is a bias that occurs when respondents answer questions in a manner designed to present themselves favorably. In a split panel design, respondents are randomly assigned into different groups to receive different versions of the questions to measure any differences between the different question wordings. Stage of data collection includes any stage or step in the sample identification and data collection process in which data are collected from the identified sample unit. This includes information obtained that is required to proceed to the next stage of sample selection or data collection (e.g., school district permission for schools to participate or schools providing lists of teachers for sample selection of teachers). Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Although the standard error is used to estimate sampling error, it includes some nonsampling error. 84"

Statistical methods include the use of sampling, estimation, imputation, or techniques for modeling or data analysis. Strata are created by partitioning the frame and are generally defined to include relatively homogeneous units within strata. A statistical survey is a data collection whose purposes include the description, estimation, or analysis of the characteristics of groups, organizations, segments, activities, or geographic areas.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly trans- forming societal interactions and the relationships among citi- zens, private businesses, and the Government. (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in applying advances in information technology to enhance govern- mental functions and services, achieve more efficient perform- ance, increase access to Government information, and increase citizen participation in Government. (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government are developed and presented separately, according to the juris- dictional boundaries of an individual department or agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function or topic. (4) Internet-based Government services involving inter- agency cooperation are especially difficult to develop and pro- mote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation. (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved Government performance and outcomes within and across agen- cies. (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the management of Government, to be implemented as part of a management framework that also addresses finance, procure- ment, human capital, and other challenges to improve the performance of Government. (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet- based technology requires strong leadership, better organiza- tion, improved interagency collaboration, and more focused oversight of agency complieuice with statutes related to informa- tion resource management. (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government efforts to develop and promote electronic Grovernment services and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new Office of Electronic Government within the Office of Management and Budget."

PUBLIC LAW 107-347—DEC. 17, 2002 116 STAT. 2901 (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen psirticipation in Government. (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing elec- tronic Government services, where this collaboration would improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government processes, where this collaboration would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes. (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve agency missions and program performance goals. (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging tech- nologies within and across Government agencies to provide citizen-centric Government information and services.

(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability of these agencies to share data £ind thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.

Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.

It is useful regardless of the maturity level and technical sophistication of an organization’s cybersecurity programs. Nevertheless, the CSF does not embrace a one-size-fits- all approach. Each organization has both common and unique risks, as well as varying risk appetites and tolerances, specific missions, and objectives to achieve those missions. By necessity, the way organizations implement the CSF will vary. Ideally, the CSF will be used to address cybersecurity risks alongside other risks of the enterprise, including those that are financial, privacy, supply chain, reputational, technological, or physical in nature. The CSF describes desired outcomes that are intended to be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise."

The CSF describes desired outcomes that are intended to be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise. Because these outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an organization with the flexibility needed to address their unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations. Outcomes are mapped directly to a list of potential security controls for immediate consideration to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Although not prescriptive, the CSF assists its users in learning about and selecting specific outcomes. Suggestions for how specific outcomes may be achieved are provided in an expanding suite of online resources that complement the CSF, including a series of Quick Start Guides (QSGs). Also, various tools offer downloadable formats to help organizations that choose to automate some of their processes. The QSGs suggest initial ways to use the CSF and invite the reader to explore the CSF and related resources in greater depth. Available through the NIST CSF website, the CSF and these supplementary resources from NIST and others should be viewed as a “CSF portfolio” to help manage and reduce risks. Regardless of how it is applied, the CSF prompts its users to consider their cybersecurity posture in context and then adapt the CSF to their specific needs."

Building on previous versions, CSF 2.0 contains new features that highlight the importance of governance and supply chains. Special attention is paid to the QSGs to ensure that the CSF is relevant and readily accessible by smaller organizations as well as their larger counterparts. NIST now provides Implementation Examples and Informative References, which are available online and updated regularly. Creating current and target state Organizational Profiles helps organizations to compare where they are versus where they want or need to be and allows them to implement and assess security controls more quickly. Cybersecurity risks are expanding constantly, and managing those risks must be a continuous process. This is true regardless of whether an organization is just beginning to confront its cybersecurity challenges or whether it has been active for many years with a sophisticated, well-resourced cybersecurity team. The CSF is designed to be valuable for any type of organization and is expected to provide appropriate guidance over a long time."

Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Overview This document is version 2.0 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Framework or CSF). It includes the following components: • CSF Core, the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks. The CSF Core components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome. These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise. Because the outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risks, technologies, and mission considerations. • CSF Organizational Profiles, which are a mechanism for describing an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes. • CSF Tiers, which can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices. Tiers can also provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes in place to manage those risks."

Tiers can also provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes in place to manage those risks. This document describes what desirable outcomes an organization can aspire to achieve. It does not prescribe outcomes nor how they may be achieved. Descriptions of how an organization can achieve those outcomes are provided in a suite of online resources that complement the CSF and are available through the NIST CSF website. These resources offer additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve outcomes and are intended to help an organization understand, adopt, and use the CSF. They include: • Informative References that point to sources of guidance on each outcome from existing global standards, guidelines, frameworks, regulations, policies, etc. • Implementation Examples that illustrate potential ways to achieve each outcome • Quick-Start Guides that give actionable guidance on using the CSF and its online resources, including transitioning from previous CSF versions to version 2.0 • Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates that help an organization put the CSF into practice and set priorities for managing cybersecurity risks An organization can use the CSF Core, Profiles, and Tiers with the supplementary resources to understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks. • Understand and Assess: Describe the current or target cybersecurity posture of part or all of an organization, determine gaps, and assess progress toward addressing those gaps. NIST CSWP 29 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 February 26, 2024 2 • Prioritize: Identify, organize, and prioritize actions for managing cybersecurity risks that align with the organization’s mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk management and governance expectations. •"

The CSF is designed to be used by organizations of all sizes and sectors, including industry, government, academia, and nonprofit organizations, regardless of the maturity level of their cybersecurity programs. The CSF is a foundational resource that may be adopted voluntarily and through governmental policies and mandates. The CSF’s taxonomy and referenced standards, guidelines, and practices are not country-specific, and previous versions of the CSF have been leveraged successfully by many governments and other organizations both inside and outside of the United States. The CSF should be used in conjunction with other resources (e.g., frameworks, standards, guidelines, leading practices) to better manage cybersecurity risks and inform the overall management of information and communications technology (ICT) risks at an enterprise level. The CSF is a flexible framework that is intended to be tailored for use by all organizations regardless of size. Organizations will continue to have unique risks — including different threats and vulnerabilities — and risk tolerances, as well as unique mission objectives and requirements."

CSF Core structure The CSF Core Functions — GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER — organize cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level. • GOVERN (GV) — The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The GOVERN Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. GOVERN addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy. • IDENTIFY (ID) — The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood. Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under GOVERN."

Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of NIST CSWP 29 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 February 26, 2024 4 improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures, and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions. • PROTECT (PR) — Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used. Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure. • DETECT (DE) — Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed. DETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities."
The_NIST_Cybersecurity_Framework.pdf,9,"DETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities. • RESPOND (RS) — Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. RESPOND supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication. • RECOVER (RC) — Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored. RECOVER supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts. Figure 2 shows the CSF Functions as a wheel because all of the Functions relate to one another. For example, an organization will categorize assets under IDENTIFY and take steps to secure those assets under PROTECT. Investments in planning and testing in the GOVERN and IDENTIFY Functions will support timely detection of unexpected events in the DETECT Function, as well as enabling incident response and recovery actions for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and RECOVER Functions."

Investments in planning and testing in the GOVERN and IDENTIFY Functions will support timely detection of unexpected events in the DETECT Function, as well as enabling incident response and recovery actions for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and RECOVER Functions. GOVERN is in the center of the wheel because it informs how an organization will implement the other five Functions. While many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on preventing negative events from occurring, they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities. Actions to reduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing revenue (e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting their own and other organizations’ data centers, then moving a major financial system from the organization’s in-house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity risks).

Subcategories further divide each Category into more specific outcomes of technical and management activities. The Subcategories are not exhaustive, but they describe detailed outcomes that support each Category. The Functions, Categories, and Subcategories apply to all ICT used by an organization, including information technology (IT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology (OT).

CSF Profiles A CSF Organizational Profile describes an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the Core’s outcomes. Organizational Profiles are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize, and communicate the Core’s outcomes by considering an organization’s mission objectives, stakeholder expectations, threat landscape, and requirements. An organization can then prioritize its actions to achieve specific outcomes and communicate that information to stakeholders. Every Organizational Profile includes one or both of the following: 1. A Current Profile specifies the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved. 2."
The_NIST_Cybersecurity_Framework.pdf,11,"A Current Profile specifies the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved. 2. A Target Profile specifies the desired outcomes that an organization has selected and prioritized for achieving its cybersecurity risk management objectives. A Target Profile considers anticipated changes to the organization’s cybersecurity posture, such as new requirements, new technology adoption, and threat intelligence trends. A Community Profile is a baseline of CSF outcomes that is created and published to address shared interests and goals among a number of organizations. A Community Profile is typically developed for a particular sector, subsector, technology, threat type, or other use case. An organization can use a Community Profile as the basis for its own Target Profile. Examples of Community Profiles can be found on the NIST CSF website.

Document the high-level facts and assumptions on which the Profile will be based to define its scope. An organization can have as many Organizational Profiles as desired, each with a different scope. For example, a Profile could address an entire organization or be scoped to an organization’s financial systems or to countering ransomware threats and handling ransomware incidents involving those financial systems. 2. Gather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile. Examples of information may include organizational policies, risk management priorities and resources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis (BIA) registers, cybersecurity requirements and standards followed by the organization, practices and tools (e.g., procedures and safeguards), and work roles."

Create the Organizational Profile. Determine what types of information the Profile should include for the selected CSF outcomes, and document the needed information. Consider the risk implications of the Current Profile to inform Target Profile planning and prioritization. Also, consider using a Community Profile as the basis for the Target Profile. 4. Analyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles, and create an action plan. Conduct a gap analysis to identify and analyze the differences between the Current and Target Profiles, and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, Plan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps. 5.

Follow the action plan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the Target Profile. An action plan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing. Given the importance of continual improvement, an organization can repeat these steps as often as needed. There are additional uses for Organizational Profiles. For example, a Current Profile can be used to document and communicate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and known opportunities for improvement with external stakeholders, such as business partners or prospective customers. Also, a Target Profile can help express the organization’s cybersecurity risk management requirements and expectations to suppliers, partners, and other third parties as a target for those parties to achieve. 3.2. CSF Tiers An organization can choose to use the Tiers to inform its Current and Target Profiles. Tiers characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices, and they provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes in place to manage those risks.

They may be produced by NIST or another organization. Some Informative References are narrower in scope than a Subcategory. For example, a particular control from SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, may be one of many references needed to achieve the outcome described in one Subcategory. Other Informative References may be higher-level, such as a requirement from a policy that partially addresses numerous Subcategories.

The_NIST_Cybersecurity_Framework.pdf,15,"Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration The CSF’s use will vary based on an organization’s unique mission and risks. With an understanding of stakeholder expectations and risk appetite and tolerance (as outlined in GOVERN), an organization can prioritize cybersecurity activities to make informed decisions about cybersecurity expenditures and actions. An organization may choose to handle risk in one or more ways — including mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting negative risks and realizing, sharing, enhancing, or accepting positive risks — depending on the potential impacts and likelihoods. Importantly, an organization can use the CSF both internally to manage its cybersecurity capabilities and externally to oversee or communicate with third parties. Regardless of the CSF’s utilization, an organization may benefit from using the CSF as guidance to help it understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks and the actions that will manage those risks. The selected outcomes can be used to focus on and implement strategic decisions to improve cybersecurity postures and maintain continuity of mission- essential functions while taking priorities and available resources into account. 5.1. Improving Risk Management Communication The CSF provides a basis for improved communication regarding cybersecurity expectations, planning, and resources. The CSF fosters bidirectional information flow (as shown in the top half of Fig. 5) between executives who focus on the organization’s priorities and strategic direction and managers who manage specific cybersecurity risks that could affect the achievement of those priorities."

Actions to close any gaps identified between the Current and Target Profiles will be implemented by managers and practitioners and will provide key inputs into system-level plans. As the target state is achieved throughout the organization — including through controls and monitoring applied at the system level — the updated results can be shared through risk registers and progress reports. As part of ongoing assessment, managers gain insights to make adjustments that further reduce potential harms and increase potential benefits. The GOVERN Function supports organizational risk communication with executives. Executives’ discussions involve strategy, particularly how cybersecurity-related uncertainties might affect the achievement of organizational objectives. These governance discussions support dialogue and agreement about risk management strategies (including cybersecurity supply chain risk); roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policies; and oversight. As executives establish cybersecurity priorities and objectives based on those needs, they communicate expectations about risk appetite, accountability, and resources. Executives are also responsible for integrating cybersecurity risk management with ERM programs and lower-level risk management programs (see Sec. 5.2). The communications reflected in the top half of Fig. 5 can include considerations for ERM and the lower-level programs and, thus, inform managers and practitioners."

The overall cybersecurity objectives set by executives are informed by and cascade to managers. In a commercial entity, these may apply to a line-of-business or operating division. For government entities, these may be division- or branch-level considerations. When implementing the CSF, managers will focus on how to achieve risk targets through common services, controls, and collaboration, as expressed in the Target Profile and improved through the actions being tracked in the action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, POA&M). Practitioners focus on implementing the target state and measuring changes in operational risk to help plan, carry out, and monitor specific cybersecurity activities. As controls are implemented to manage risk at an acceptable level, practitioners provide managers and executives with the information (e.g., key performance indicators, key risk indicators) they need to understand the organization’s cybersecurity posture, make informed decisions, and maintain or adjust the risk strategy accordingly. Executives can also combine this cybersecurity risk data with information about other types of risk from across the organization."

Improving Integration with Other Risk Management Programs Every organization faces numerous types of ICT risk (e.g., privacy, supply chain, artificial intelligence) and may use frameworks and management tools that are specific to each risk. Some organizations integrate ICT and all other risk management efforts at a high level by using ERM, while others keep the efforts separate to ensure adequate attention on each. Small NIST CSWP 29 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 February 26, 2024 12 organizations by their nature may monitor risk at the enterprise level, while larger companies may maintain separate risk management efforts integrated into the ERM.

Cybersecurity and privacy risk relationship Cybersecurity risk management is essential for addressing privacy risks related to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individuals’ data. For example, data breaches could lead to identity theft. However, privacy risks can also arise by means that are unrelated to cybersecurity incidents. An organization processes data to achieve mission or business purposes, which can sometimes give rise to privacy events whereby individuals may experience problems as a result of the data processing. These problems can be expressed in various ways, but NIST describes them as ranging from dignity-type effects (e.g., embarrassment or stigma) to more tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm). The NIST Privacy Framework and Cybersecurity Framework can be used together to address the different aspects of cybersecurity and privacy risks.

All types of technology rely on a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem with geographically diverse routes and multiple levels of outsourcing. This ecosystem is composed of public- and private-sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other technology-related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage technology products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices. Given the complex and interconnected relationships in this ecosystem, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is critical for organizations. Cybersecurity SCRM (C-SCRM) is a systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risk throughout supply chains and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and procedures.

Its components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome. CSF Current Profile A part of an Organizational Profile that specifies the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved. CSF Function The highest level of organization for cybersecurity outcomes. There are six CSF Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
